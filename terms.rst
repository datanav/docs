(SaaS)

1. Introduction
===============

1.1. Purpose
------------

This documents contains terms of service for Customers' access to and
use of SESAM Software as a Service (“Services”) provided by SESAM.io AS,
922 409 676 (“SESAM”). The services consist of both free- and paid
subscriptions and the term “Customer” is used regardless of whether a
Subscription Fee applies to a particular Customer's account. Some
sections of this document will only apply to Customers with an account
with a defined Subscription Fee. Upon ordering access to the Services,
and confirming acceptance of the terms of service in this document, a
legally binding agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between SESAM
and the Customer. All Services, as they are available at any time,
through the portal https://portal.sesam.io, are subject to the terms of
this Agreement.

Upon entering into this Agreement and the registration of the Customer
in SESAM's systems, the Customer is given a right to use the Services on
the terms in this Agreement. Once access to the Services has been
granted, the Customer will receive an e-mail to its registered email
address with the necessary access and login details.

The Services consist of various sub-services, and the right to use the
Services only comprise the individual sub-services which the Customer
has ordered and received access to. Some of the Services are payable.
Appendix 1 sets out the sub-services that the Customer has ordered at
the time of signature of this Agreement. The Customer’s account overview
sets out active sub- services which the Customer has ordered, including
which Services are payable.

Some sub-services may be subject to additional terms and/or
restrictions. Such additional terms and/or restrictions are set out in
Appendix 1 and/or the terms of use for the sub-service together with the
description of the sub-service in question.

1.2. Description of the Services
--------------------------------

The Services are standardized services, and the Customer acknowledges
that the functionality in the Services will change. The Customer is
given the right to use the Services, with the functionality as provided
from time to time. The right to use the Services is not connected to any
specific version of the underlying software or any set functionality as
provided at any time, but is rather connected to access to and use of
the Services as they are at any given time. Details of the functionality
of each of the Services can be found at https://docs.sesam.io.

2. The Right to use the Services
================================

2.1. General
------------

The Customer may set up Users and give these Users access to the
Services with different roles (each individual referred to herein as a
“User” and collectively as the “Users”). Users consist of natural
persons in the employment or service of the Customer.

The Customer and the Customer's Users receive a worldwide, limited,
terminable, non-exclusive and nontransferable right to use the Services
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, exclusively for the
Customer's internal business purposes. This right is conditional on the
payment of the applicable subscription fee and other fees as set out in
Appendix 2 (“Subscription Fee”). Any applicable Subscription Fee is
provided on the Customer's account overview.

The Payment of the Subscription Fee and the compliance with the terms of
this Agreement is a precondition for the right to use the Services.

SESAM may adjust the agreed Subscription Fee yearly, upon 3 months'
written notice. In case of changes in public taxes, charges or other
duties or other changes in public administrative practice affects the
vendor's costs connected to the Service, the Subscription Fee may be
adjusted correspondingly without prior notice.

The Customer may not allow a third party to use the Services in a
service bureau or similar, or offer services dependent on the Services
to a third party. However, the Customer may allow in- hire consultants
or temporary employees to use the Services for Customers internal
business purposes. The Customer may also use the Services to
collect/deliver data from the applications and databases of the
Customer's suppliers and/or customers.

The Services depend on standard software. When purchasing access to the
Services, the Customer does not purchase a copy of, or license to, the
software used to deliver the Services, but consecutively pay for a
subscription to access the Services. To the extent that separate
license- or other terms apply for use of third party software and/ or
services included in the Services, these are set out in Appendix 1
and/or together with the description of the Services in question. Any
terms for third party software and/or services take precedence over the
terms of this Agreement.

2.2. The relationship between the Customer's Users and SESAM
------------------------------------------------------------

The Customer commits to adhere to the terms of this Agreement, and to
ensure that any of its Users do the same. The Customer accepts the full
responsibility for all activities connected to its Users, and its User's
compliance with the terms of the Agreement. When the individual User
accepts any terms upon logging into a Service, or on a later change of
such terms, no Agreement is made between such individual User and SESAM.
It is at all times the Customer who is party to any agreement with
SESAM, and who has all rights and obligations set out in such agreement.

The Customer accepts that SESAM may contact the Customer, and any
Customer administrators, through registered e-mail addresses and through
telephone, and provide general marketing information or other
information about the Services. Such information will not be sent to the
Customer's other Users.

2.3. User administration
------------------------

If the Customer is a physical person, the Customer will be assigned a
single user.

If the Customer is a legal person, Users are created and administrated
by the Customer. Customer's administrators for this Agreement should be
communicated to SESAM.

The log-on information of an individual User shall not be shared or used
by more than one physical person, but may freely be re-assigned by the
Customer's administrator. The Customer's administrator may also name
further administrators and delete Users. The Customer shall ensure that
all information about Users and administrators are up to date at all
times.

Each User is responsible for keeping his/her Username and password
confidential. The Customer shall inform SESAM immediately in case of
unauthorized use of a User's log-on

information. Users are authorized to provide SESAM's support personnel
with access to their accounts where such access is necessary to provide
support or else performed tasks asked for by the User.

2.4. Requirements for use of the Services
-----------------------------------------

The Customer and any of its Users shall not transfer viruses, malware or
any other harmful code to the Services or use the Services in a manner
which gives a risk for such transfer. The Services shall not be used for
any illegal or otherwise unauthorized purpose. When the Services are
used outside of Norway, in cases where the Customer's Users temporarily
are staying abroad, the Customer is responsible for complying with the
Norwegian, EU and United States of America export restrictions and
-regulations, including assuring that the Services are not used in
jurisdictions where such use would be contrary to such export
restrictions and -regulations.

3. Technical information
========================

The Services will be delivered through the operating environment
selected by SESAM at any time, unless it is agreed with the Customer
that the Customer will use another operating environment. The Customer
will be given minimum three moths' notice in case of significant changes
to the operating environment. SESAM reserves the right to change the
operating environment, but will in such event notify the Customer of the
change and of technical and legal effects of such change.

At the present time the operating environment selected by SESAM is
Microsoft Azure. For Azure, separate terms of service apply from
Microsoft:
https://azure.microsoft.com/enus/support/legal/subscription-agreement/?
country=no&language=en and “Online Services Terms”. These terms apply as
amended and updated by Microsoft at any time. SESAM has no
responsibility for error and defects in such services.

SESAM and the Customer may agree on special requirements for the
operating environment in a separate agreement.

further states the Parties' obligations and rights as Controller and
Processor, regarding the Processor's processing of Personal Data on
behalf of the Controller.

SESAM as the Processor, shall only process data in accordance with the
Data Processing Agreement included as Appendix 3 to this Agreement.

6. Fees and Payment Terms
=========================

For Services included in this Agreement, the Customer may have payed a
Subscription Fee to SESAM as set out in Appendix 2.

Dynamic price model: The price model set out in Appendix 2 is a dynamic
(running) price model that is renewed automatically until terminated by
one of the parties as set out in section 11.

Fixed price model: A fixed price model entails that Sesam gives a 50%
discount of a set amount of data (GB), based on the dynamic price set
out in Appendix 2, and provided that the Customer in the Agreement
agrees to the fixed price model for a renewable term of 12 months.

If the Parties agrees upon fixed price, the Agreement will be for a term
of 12 months calculated from the date it is agreed between the parties
that the model is fixed price (most often the Date the Agreement is
signed by both parties). If the Customer uses more data than the agreed
upon fixed price model allows for that term, the fee for the data amount
(GB) surpassing the agreed upon fixed price, will be double of what
follows from the dynamic price model in Appendix 2.

The Agreement will automatically be renewed with the same data amount
(GB) for the following 12 months as that of the running term, unless the
Customer gives at least one (1) month written notice prior to the
expiration of the running term that they do not want to continue with
the fixed price model at all, or if they want to make adjust to a higher
or lower fixed price model for the following 12 months term. Renewals
each 12 months will continue as long as the Agreement is running.

The Parties can additionally agree upon a support level of 24/7 provided
that the Customer has agreed to a fixed price model of 50 GB/month or
higher.

7. Right to Audit and Control
=============================

The provisions in this section apply only to the Customers who pay a
Subscription Fee.

applicable governmental requirements/legislation, allow the Customer's
internal or external auditors to observe SESAM's delivery of the
Services with related Customer data and any documentation for the
Services for the Customer. The Customer shall give reasonable notice
before such audits, at least 20 calendar days, and the audit shall be
carried out during normal business hours as set out in this Agreement.
The Customer acknowledges that scope of audit shall be limited to
SESAM's own delivery of Service, as well as applicable documentation.

The Customers may not utilize auditors who are in direct competition
with SESAM. The auditor(s) shall sign a confidentiality statement. The
Customer shall adhere to SESAM's applicable regulations when access is
given to SESAM's facilities.

possible further quality assurance that the Customer may require, will
be invoiced to the Customer in accordance with SESAM's applicable rates.

8. Changes to the Agreement
===========================

SESAM reserves the right to change the terms of this Agreement upon at
least 30 days' notice.

Reference is made to SESAM's limited opportunity to change the terms in
sections 5.2 and 5. regarding the processing of data. SESAM may not
change section 5.1. to the detriment of the Customer.

9. Infringement of Third Party Rights
=====================================

The provisions in this section apply only to the Customers who pay a
Subscription Fee. SESAM shall defend the Customer against claims or law
suits set forth by third parties claiming that the Customer's use of the
Services infringes that third party's registered Norwegian or EU
intellectual property rights, including, without limitations, patents,
copyright, trade secrets, trademark or any other intellectual property
rights. In the event of such claims the Customer shall immediately
inform SESAM in writing.

SESAM shall, to the extent SESAM is responsible for the infringement,
hold the Customer harmless against all costs, damages, expenses or
losses that the Customer is ordered to pay by a court or agrees to pay
in a settlement, including attorney fees. This is subject to the full
co- operation of the Customer with SESAM and that SESAM is in full
control of the legal process and negotiations for a settlement. SESAM
may at its own discretion (i) modify the Services so that there is no
longer any infringement of third party rights, (ii) replace the Services
with functionally equivalent services, (iii) provide a right for the
Customer's continued use of the Services. If these options are not
available, SESAM may or (iv) terminate the Customer's access to the
Products and Services with a refund of any fees paid for the
subscription after the date of termination. The Customer may not set
forth any other claims as a result of infringement of third party
rights.

The previous right to be held harmless does not apply if the Services
have been used in violation of these terms and conditions or if the
claim arises out of any modification, integration or customization of
the Services not performed by SESAM.

The Customer shall defend SESAM against any claims or lawsuits in which
a third-party claim that the Customer's data or use of the Services in
combination with the Customer's own applications, databases or other
systems, is inconsistent with or infringes a third party's intellectual
property rights, including without limitations, patents, copyright,
trade secrets, trademark or any other intellectual property rights.
SESAM shall immediately notify the Customer in writing in the event of
such claims.

The Customer shall hold SESAM harmless against all costs, damages,
expenses or losses

that SESAM is sentenced to pay by a court or agrees to in a settlement,
including attorney fees, provided that SESAM cooperates with the
Customer at the Customer's own expense and that SESAM provides the
Customer with full control over the legal process and settlement, and
that the settlement releases SESAM from all liability.

10. Liability, Limitation of Liability etc.
===========================================

10.1. Limitation of liability
-----------------------------

If SESAM is held responsible for paying damages to the Customer as a
consequence of breaches of any of the obligations under this Agreement,
such damages will under no condition include compensation for indirect
loss or damages of any kind that may arise as a result of, or in
connection with, such breach. Indirect loss includes, but is not limited
to, loss of profit of any kind, losses as a consequence of disrupted
operations, loss of data, lost savings, losses due to deprivation and
claims from third parties (except as set out in section 9 above).
SESAM'S liability under this Agreement is therefore limited to direct
loss, unless otherwise set out in mandatory applicable law, for example
damages due to gross negligence or intent. Any refunds or compensation
for direct loss and costs during any 12-month period shall not exceed an
amount equivalent to 6 month's Subscription Fee's ex. VAT for the
Services during the same period.

If standardized sanctions are agreed, these standardized sanctions shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy for the matter and no other claims may
be made based on the same situation.

10.2. Force majeure
-------------------

If the use and execution of the Services is wholly or partly prevented
or materially impeded by circumstances beyond the parties' control, both
parties' obligations are suspended for as long as the circumstances are
relevant and as long as these circumstances lasts. Such circumstances
include, but are not limited to, strikes, lockouts, and any relationship
which under Norwegian law will be regarded as force majeure. Each party
may, however, in accordance with section 11 of this Agreement, terminate
the Agreement if the force majeure makes it particularly burdensome for
that party to continue the Agreement.

In the event that law, rules or regulations applicable to the use or
delivery of the Services is changed or new rules or regulations are
adopted after the Services have been made available on the market and
this prevents SESAM from fulfilling the Customer's instructions pursuant
to the Data Processing Agreement in Appendix 3 or other obligation in
this Agreement, and/or this requires full or partial termination of
access to the Services for a limited or indefinite period of time, this
shall be considered as a force majeure circumstance. SESAM is not in any
way responsible for any such or other force majeure circumstance.

10.3. Circumstances for which SESAM not in any event is responsible
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though SESAM will use appropriate care to ensure secure
transmission of information between the Customer and the Services, the
Customer recognizes that the Internet is an open system, and that SESAM
cannot warrant that a third party cannot or will not intercept or alter
data during the transmission. SESAM takes no responsibility for such
unauthorized access to, use or alternation or publication or loss of
data.

Neither is SESAM responsible for lack of availability of the Services
when this is directly or indirectly caused by the Customer or by
circumstances for which the Customer is responsible or the
reconstruction of data regardless of cause.

11. Cancellation and Suspension
===============================

The Customer may cancel the Services or individual sub-services and
thereby cancel the entire subscription for SESAM's Service using the
Customer's account tool with applicable notice

period. The cancellation takes effect from the start of the first month
after end of the notice period. If a minimum term has been agreed for
some of the Services, the termination takes effect after the expiration
of such minimum term.

For non-paying Customers SESAM has the right to suspend or terminate
access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without
cause, with 14 days' prior notice. In case of abuse, access to Services
may be suspended or terminated without notice, effective immediately.

The provisions for the reminding of this section apply only to the
Customers who pay a Subscription Fee.

If a minimum term applies for some of the Services, the termination by
the Customer takes effect after the expiration of such minimum term.

If payment is not made within 30 days after the due date, SESAM may,
provided that the amount outstanding is not insignificant, suspend the
Customer's access to the Services until payment is made. Suspension
shall be notified in writing by SESAM, with a final and reasonable
deadline for the Customer to settle the amount outstanding before
suspension is made effective. SESAM may terminate the Customer's
accounts for the Services if payment is not made to SESAM within 14 days
after such suspension is made effective. The Customer shall pay delayed
interest in accordance with applicable law for all Subscription Fees
that are not settled before their due date. SESAM may make renewal of
the Customer's subscription conditional on a shorter payment due date or
increased invoice frequency after one case of delayed payment.

SESAM may terminate the Customer's subscription with 7 days' written
notice if the Customer is in breach of any of his obligations under this
Agreement, or if it becomes apparent that the Customer will materially
breach this Agreement in the future. SESAM may with 6 days' written
notice to the Customer also suspend the Customer's subscription to the
Services if the Agreement is breached by the Customer. Such suspension
may be in effect until the matter has been resolved.

SESAM reserves the right to terminate any service in its entirety, or
its availability in any market, with 6 months' notice before such
termination takes effect or in case of force majeure with such notice
which is reasonable under the circumstances.

When the Services, hereunder Users, are terminated, all data and copies
of such data will be deleted from SESAMs servers upon the termination
taking effect. The Customer will get access to his data as set out in
section 5.1.

The limitation period for any claims arising in connection with this
Agreement or breach of this Agreement is one year after the termination
of the agreement. Claims forwarded after the limitation period is out of
date and hence have no validity.

===================

Information that comes into the possession of the parties in connection
with implementation of the Agreement shall be kept confidential and
shall not be disclosed to any third party without the consent of the
other party.

If the Customer is a public body, the scope of the confidentiality
obligation under this provision shall not go beyond that laid down by
the Act of 10 February 1967 relating to Procedure in Cases concerning
the Public Administration (Public Administration Act) or corresponding
sector-specific regulations.

The confidentiality obligation pursuant to this provision shall not
prevent the disclosure of information if such disclosure is demanded
pursuant to laws or regulations, including any disclosure or right of

access pursuant to the Act of 19 May 2006 relating to the Right of
Access to Documents in the Public Administration (Freedom of Information
Act). The other party shall, if possible, be notified prior to the
disclosure of such information.

The confidentiality obligation shall not prevent the information from
being used when there is no legitimate interest in keeping it
confidential, for example when it is in the public domain or is
accessible to the public elsewhere.

The parties shall take all necessary precautions to prevent unauthorised
persons from gaining access to, or knowledge of, confidential
information.

The confidentiality obligation shall apply to the parties' employees,
subcontractors and other third parties who act on behalf of the parties
in connection with the implementation of the Agreement. The parties may
only transmit confidential information to such subcontractors and third
parties to the extent necessary for the implementation of the Agreement,
and provided that they are subjected to a confidentiality obligation
corresponding to that stipulated in this clause.

The confidentiality obligation shall not prevent the parties from
utilising experience and expertise developed in connection with the
implementation of the Agreement.

The confidentiality obligation shall continue to apply after the expiry
of the Agreement. Employees or others who resign from their positions
with one of the parties shall be subjected to a confidentiality
obligation following their resignation as well, as far as factors
mentioned above are concerned. The confidentiality obligation shall
lapse five (5) years after the Agreement comes to an end, unless
otherwise is stipulated by law or regulations.

equivalents) for discussion and resolution. If such parties fail to
resolve the dispute within 14 days, then such dispute will be referred
to the party's respective Chief Operating Officer (or equivalent) for
discussion and attempted resolution. If such dispute cannot be mutually
resolved by such parties within 14 days, then either party may request
that the case is brought before a Norwegian court. If the parties so
agree, the case shall be decided by arbitration after Norwegian Act of
14. May 2004 no. 25 on arbitration. If the parties require confidential
treatment of the arbitration proceedings, hereunder the arbitration
court's verdict, this shall be agreed between the parties in writing
