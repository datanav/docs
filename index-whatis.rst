What is Sesam
=============

Sesam is a master data hub that simplifies the process of making
up-to-date master data available in a data platform architecture. Sesam
enables rapid development of solutions that can be effectively
managed on top of a data platform. 

Sesam is a data platform component that collects data from source systems and connects all representations of an object across a variety of source systems in a continuously updated
and dynamic `data model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model>`_, and makes the data easily accessible inside the data platform.
