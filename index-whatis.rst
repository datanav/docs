What is Sesam
=============

Sesam is a Master Data Hub  that simplifies the process of making up-to-date master data available in a data platform architecture. 

The updated data within Sesam Data Hub is not only consumable by analytical components in the data platform, but it can also be synchronized back to relevant source systems to ensure data consistency across the whole platform.

With Sesam you can rapidly develop solutions that are effectively managed on top of your data platform.
As a data platform component, Sesam improves data-consistency by collecting data from source systems and connecting all representations of an object across a variety of source systems in a continuously updated and dynamic `data model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model>`_.
