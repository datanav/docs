   * - SaaS-Service
     - Specification of tasks and contents of Sesam SaaS-Service
   * - 1. Description of the SaaS-Service
     - SESAM is a data-oriented integration platform delivered as a Service
       as described on https://docs.sesam.io. The Service may be configured
       to fetch data from various systems and databases, and the data that is
       so collected and stored in SESAM. Such configuration may be performed
       by the Customer or by a separate consulting agreement between SESAM
       and Customer.
   * - 2. Requirements for scaleability
     - The SaaS-Service can be scaled both in terms of the number of Users,
       amounts of data and requirements for computing capacity.
   * - 3. Backup and securing data
     - SESAM shall keep the Customer's data logically separated from any third
       parties' data to limit the risk of data loss or unauthorized disclosure. By
       «logically separated» is meant that necessary technical measures securing
       the data against unwanted alteration and access are implemented.

       The cloud service, as a basis, only contains copies of data from other
       sources that the Customer has chosen to integrate with, and transformations
       of such data. Therefore, all data may be re-imported and recreated when
       needed for such sources. Re-creating from back-up may, however, be faster
       for large quantities of data.
   * - 4. Reconstruction of data
     - If data is lost or corrupted due to causes which SESAM is responsible for,
       SESAM shall re-establish the data from the latest backup within reasonable
       time and at SESAM's own cost, if not otherwise agreed below.

       SESAM's responsibility for costs is limited to the costs for re-establishment
       of the data from the latest backup, and additional costs that may arise due
       to SESAM not having performed backups as set forth in the Agreement.
       Costs attributable to reconstruction of data after the latest backup may only
       be attributed to SESAM if the data loss is due to gross negligence by
       SESAM. If the cause of the data loss is such that the Customer shall carry
       the costs, the Customer shall approve the scope of the work before it
       commences.
   * - 5. Notification of updates of the Services
     - Major updates and planned maintenance / downtime is notified through the
       SESAM Service Desk.
   * - 6. System documentation for the Services
     - SESAM is documented here: https://docs.sesam.io
   * - 7. Third party cloud services included in the Services

          *or*

          Third party
          cloud services are included in the Services, but it is set forth in
          this agreement that the Customer will provide the operating
          environment
     - SESAM is delivered as a SaaS from virtual servers in Microsoft Azure
       Cloud. For Azure, separate terms of service apply from Microsoft as set
       out in TOS section 3:. These terms are binding on the Customer as they are
       amended and updated by Microsoft at any given time.

       *or*

       It is agreed between the parties that the Customer will acquire and use
       another operating environment with their own terms of service, when using
       SESAM's Services. The Customer is responsible for entering into contract
       with the supplier of the operating environment.
   * - 8. The Customer's responsibility in connection with the Services
     - Configuring routers and firewalls for expanding the Customer's network to
       include the Services, included securing the network communication.
       Configuring access to applications to be integrated with the Service.
       SESAM will assist with specifications for network configuration.

2. Service level agreement and standardized refunds
===================================================

Since SESAM is delivered as SaaS, the Customer may consecutively select
capacity and service levels as required. The applicable selected
capacity and SLA-level will be defined at the Customer's My Page on the
SESAM-portal.

The Customer shall report errors to SESAM according to the following
procedure: Through SESAM Service Desk.
