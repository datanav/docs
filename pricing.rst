Developer environment
---------------------
A developer environment has a fixed price and serves a single developer, or a CI test environment.
These do not have support for backup, VPN, or SLA and can not host test, staging or production environments. The development environment is cloud-only and restricted.
We strongly encourage following `test-driven development practices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_
by using the :doc:`Sesam Client <hub/sesam-client>`.
