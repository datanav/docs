Subscription Fee, payment terms
===============================

1. Subscription fee
===================

The Subscription Fee for the Services are set
depending on the computing power, data volume, selected monitoring
functionality and SLA-level.

Fees for standard services are set out in Euro, and are calculated into
Norwegian Kroner based on the Central Bank of Norway's exchange rate on
the invoicing day.

Compute is automatically upgraded if data use exceeds specified limits. You
can upgrade without additional data storage in case you want higher performance.

If data storage is more than 1TB you will be billed with an additional Multi
compute for every TB above 1TB. As an example, if you have 4,5TB of data you
will be billed with 5 quantities of Multi computes.

The fees for the Services are set out below in Euro exclusive of VAT:

Developer environment
---------------------
A developer environment has a fixed price and serves a single developer, or a CI test environment. 
These do not have support for backup, VPN, or SLA and can not host test, staging or production environments. The development environment is cloud-only and restricted.
We strongly encourage following `test-driven development practices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_
by using the :doc:`Sesam Client <sesam-client>`.
