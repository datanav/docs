    Collect data<tutorial-getting-started-collect>
    Enrich data<tutorial-getting-started-enrich>
    Connect data<tutorial-getting-started-connect>
    Transform data<tutorial-getting-started-transform>
    Share data<tutorial-getting-started-share>

In this guide you will show you how a general simplistic Sesam synchronization may take form. The goal is to give you an introductionary overview of the 5 standard phases (Collect, Enrich, Connect, Transform and Share) used in all Sesam synchronizations and to see their effects in `HubSpot <https://www.hubspot.com/>`_.

In this guide, as in the main set of tutorials outside "Getting Started", we will use HubSpot as our baseline. If you do not have a HubSpot account already you can, `create a HubSpot developer account here <https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started>`_. Once you have a developer account you need to set up a `test account <https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-do-i-create-a-test-account>`_ in order to `aquire an API key <https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key>`_. You will need this key to access HubSpot's APIs which we need to do in these "Getting Started" Tutorials.
