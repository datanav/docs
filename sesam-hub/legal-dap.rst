2. Processing of Personal Data on the Controller's behalf
=========================================================

2.1.1 This Agreement comes into force if and when the Customer chooses to enter
and store Personal Data in the Services. The Agreement is an appendix to
the Principal Agreement and does not imply any changes to the commercial
terms between the parties.

2.1.2 The object of this Agreement is to set out the rights and obligations pursuant
to the GDPR, the prevailing Norwegian Act on the Processing of Personal
Data, with additional Regulation(s). This Agreement shall ensure that the
Personal Data regarding the Data Subjects is not used in a non-compliant
manner or compromised to un-authorized parties.

2.1.3 SESAM will process Personal Data necessary for the purpose to perform the
Services in accordance to the Agreement, and as further instructed by
Customer in its use of the Services.

2.1.4 This Agreement shall ensure that the Personal Data processed by the
Processor on behalf of the Controller, is only processed in compliance with
Applicable Laws and according to the Controller's documented instructions.

2.1.5 The subject matter of the Processing of the Personal Data is set out in the
Principal Agreement and this Agreement, and the duration of the processing
shall be for the duration of the Customer's right to use the Services pursuant
to the Principal Agreement.

2.1.6 The Processor will typically not have access to the Personal Data. The
Personal Data is only to be stored in the Processor's operating environment.
Where Personal Data is stored in the operating environment that is part of the
Processor's Services, the Processor shall only monitor and provide support
on the Services and not process the Personal Data in any way other than
what is stipulated in the Principal Agreement. If the Controller wants the
Processor to carry out any other form of processing of the Personal Data, the
Controller must make the request by a written change order to the Processor.
Further/other processing of the Personal Data as a result of such a change
order may lead to increased costs for the Processor and must thus be
covered by the Controller, see section 2.5.

2.1.7 Where the Controller stores the Personal Data in their own operating
environment, the Processor will not be able to access the Personal Data
unless the Controller provides such access. The Processor shall monitor and
provide support on the Services and not process the Personal Data in any
way other than what is stipulated in the Principal Agreement. If the Controller
wants the Processor to carry out any other form of processing of the Personal
Data, the Controller must make the request by a written change order to the
Processor and then provide access to the Personal Data. Further/other
processing of the Personal Data as a result of such a change order may lead
to increased costs for the Processor and must thus be covered by the
Controller, see section 2.5.

2.2 Categories of Personal Data and Data Subjects
-------------------------------------------------

2.2.1 The Customer may submit Personal Data to the Services, which may include,
but is not limited to, categories of Personal Data such as first and last name,
home address, mobile number, job title, date of birth, education/qualifications,
personal identification number, salary, bank account number, passwords,
pictures and so on.

2.2.2 The Customer may submit Personal Data to the Services, which may include,
but is not limited to, categories of Data Subjects such as customers, end
users, employees, agents, advisors, job applicants, partners, suppliers,
clients and customers.

this must be specifically agreed upon with the Processor in advance of such
Processing.

2.3 The Controller's Obligations
--------------------------------

2.3.1 The Controller shall provide the Processor with written instructions on the
processing of the Personal Data on behalf of the Controller, hereunder
transferring the Personal Data to any country or territory as reasonably
necessary for the provision of the Services and consistent with the Principal
Agreement and in accordance with Applicable Laws.

2.3.2 The Controller shall ensure that the processing of the Personal Data is lawful.

2.3.3 The Controller shall authorise the Processor to provide each Subprocessor
with the same written instructions that the Processor has been provided with.

2.3.4 The Controller has provided the Data Subjects with the necessary information
according to Applicable Laws; and it is the responsibility of the Controller to
collect any consents from the Data Subjects for the processing of Personal
Data taking place according to the Principal Agreement.

2.4 The Processor's obligations
-------------------------------

2.4.1 The Processor shall only process the Personal Data on behalf of the
Controller and on written instructions from the Controller, unless Processing
is required by Applicable Laws to which the Processor is subject, in which
case the Processor shall to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws inform
the Controller of that legal requirement before the relevant Processing. The
Processor shall only process the Personal Data for the sole purpose and to
the extent necessary to provide the Services, in accordance with the terms in
this Agreement and Applicable Laws.

2.4.2 The Processor does not have the right of use of the Personal Data, and may
therefore not process them for their own purposes under any circumstances.

2.4.3 The Processor has carried out the technical and organizational security
measures as described in this Agreement's section 4, in order to protect the
Personal Data from loss, misuse or un-authorized alternation or
dissemination, or against other illegal processing. These measures represent
a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing,
taking into account the costs of the implementation.

2.4.4 The Processor shall give the Controller access to its applicable security
documentation, and in other respects assist, so that the Controller may
comply with his own responsibilities according to Applicable Laws.

2.4.5 The Controller has, unless otherwise agreed or pursuant to Applicable Laws,
the right to access the Personal Data being processed and the systems used
for this purpose. The Processor shall provide necessary assistance for such
access to be given.

2.4.6 The Processor is subject to confidentiality regarding the documentation and
the Personal Data for which it gains access to under this Agreement. This
provision also applies after the termination of this Agreement.

2.4.7 The Processor may freely choose where it geographically stores the Personal
Data, although in such a manner that the Personal Data shall not be stored in
countries outside of EU/EEA without a separate written agreement or the
transfer/storage being included in a special arrangement (e.g. “SCC”). The
Controller may at any time require information on where the Personal Data is
stored.

2.4.8 The Processor shall, without undue delay, notify the Controller on any
request from governmental authorities or the police regarding the disclosure
of the Personal Data, unless this is prohibited (e.g. prohibited by the Penal
Code to preserve the confidentiality of an investigation), on any unauthorized
access to or unauthorized disclosure of the Personal Data (see section 7.1)
and on any request received directly from a Data Subject, without answering
the request unless otherwise authorized to do so. The Processor will only
disclose the Personal Data to governmental authorities or the police when
legally obliged to do so, e.g. court order, judgement, order with a basis in law
or similar.

2.5 In the case that the Controller's instructions or the Processor's
assistance to the Controller lead to increased costs for the Processor
compared to what was initially agreed upon between the parties, the
Controller shall compensate the Processor for the increased cost in
accordance with the Processor's regular terms and hourly rates.

3. Processor's Personnel
========================

3.1 The Processor shall take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability
of any employee, agent or contractor of the Processor who is given
access to the Personal Data.

3.2 The Processor shall ensure in each case that access is strictly
limited to those individuals who need to know/have access to the
relevant Personal Data, as strictly necessary for the purposes of the
Principal Agreement, and to comply with Applicable Laws in the context
of that individual's duties to the Processor.

3.3 The Processor shall ensure that all such individuals are subject to
confidentiality undertakings or professional or statutory obligations of
confidentiality. The obligations of confidentiality will survive the
termination of the personnel engagement.

4. Security
===========

4.1 Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing
as well as the risk of varying likelihood and
severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Processor shall in relation to
the Personal Data implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk, including, as appropriate, the measures
referred to in GDPR Article 32 (1). The safeguards are designed to prevent accidental or
unlawful destructions, loss, alteration, unauthorized access, security oversight and
enforcement.

4.2 In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Processor shall
take account in particular of the risks that are presented by
Processing, in particular from a Personal Data Breach.

4.3 The Controller confirms that the Processor has provided sufficient
guarantees that they will implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures that ensure that the processing meets the
requirements of Applicable Laws, hereunder the protection of the Data
Subjects' rights.

4.4 The Controller confirms to have assessed any security measures
specifically stated in the Principal Agreement and thus accepted by the
Controller, and the Controller is responsible (as between the parties
and to data subjects and supervisory authorities) if those measures in
themselves do not meet the GDPR standard of appropriateness. In the
assessment the Controller has taken into account that any pre-stated
description may only deal with specific aspects of the required security
arrangements rather than describing a comprehensive solution.

4.5 The Processor will maintain the measures for the protection of
security, confidentiality and integrity of the Personal Data. Measures
are described in our Privacy Policies and is set fort in the Principal
Agreement clause 5. The SESAM Services are upon accepting this Agreement
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified.

5. Subprocessing
================

Subprocessor appointed in accordance with this section 5 to appoint)
Subprocessors in accordance with this section 5 and any restrictions in
the Principal Agreement.

5.2 The Processor may continue to use those Subprocessors already
engaged by the Processor as of the date this Agreement enters into
force, subject to the Processor in each case as soon as practicable
meeting the obligations set out in section 5.4.

5.3 The Processor shall give the Controller prior written notice of the
appointment of any new Subprocessor, including full details of the
Processing to be undertaken by the Subprocessor. If, within 2 weeks of
receipt of that notice, the Controller notifies the Processor in writing
of any objections (on reasonable grounds) to the proposed appointment,
the Processor shall not appoint (or disclose any Personal Data to) that
proposed Subprocessor until reasonable steps have been taken to address
the objections raised by the Controller, and the Controller has been
provided with a reasonable written explanation of the steps taken.

5.4 The Processor is responsible for the Suprocessor's performance in
regards of the processing of Personal Data in accordance with the
requirements of the GDPR.

5.5 With respect to each Subprocessor, the Processor shall:

5.5.1 before the Subprocessor's first processing of the Personal Data (or, where
relevant, in accordance with section 5.2), ensure that the Subprocessor does
not process Personal Data covered by this Agreement in any way that is not
necessary for the performance of the Services, and that the Personal Data is
not given to anyone else without this being specified in this Agreement or is
permitted by the Controller in a prior written notice;

5.5.2 ensure that the arrangement between the Processor and the Subprocessor,
is governed by a written contract including terms which offer at least the
same level of protection for the Personal Data as those set out in this
Agreement and meet the requirements of GDPR article 28 (3); and

5.5.3 provide to the Controller for review such copies of the Processors'
agreements with Subprocessors (which may be redacted to remove
confidential commercial information not relevant to the requirements of this
Agreement) as the Controller may request from time to time.

5.6 Processing of Personal Data outside of the EU/EEA

5.6.1 If the agreement between the Processor and the Subprocessor involves a
transfer to a Third Country, the Standard Contractual Clauses must at all
relevant times be incorporated into the agreement between the Processor
and the Subprocessor. Or, prior to the Subprocessor's first processing of
Personal Data, the Processor must ensure that the Subprocessor enters into
an independent agreement with the Controller that incorporates the Standard
Contractual Clauses;

5.6.2 If the Processor is to enter into an agreement with Subprocessors in
countries outside the EU/EEA, this should only be done according to EU
model agreements for the transfer of personal data to Third Countries, or
other applicable legal grounds for transfers to Third Countries in accordance
with GDPR Chapter 5. The same applies even if Personal Data is stored in
the EU/EEA when personnel with access to the data are located outside the
EU/EEA.

5.6.3 If the Controller approves such transfers, the Processor shall cooperate with
the Controller to ensure the legality of the transfers.

6. Data Subject Rights
