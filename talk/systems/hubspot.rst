Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Why is website of a company not being updated from other connected systems?
***************************************************************************

In Hubspot the company field for **website** is read-only. That means that we can not write new domains into this field. 

If you want to change the domain name of a company, you should do it in HubSpot.

Why do I get company duplicates in HubSpot when I connect other systems?
************************************************************************

HubSpot does not have a unique identifier for companies that is safe enough to perform a merge of companies. In other words, we are unable to safely merge companies in HubSpot and duplicates might appear over time.

.. note ::

    Remember that we **do not delete** data from your systems. You will need to manage deduplication in your other systems, if duplication accurs.

Why is the address of my contact in HubSpot not up to date?
***********************************************************

In Hubspot the contact field for **address** is read-only. That means that we can not write data into this field. 

If you want to change the address of a contact, you should do it in HubSpot.
