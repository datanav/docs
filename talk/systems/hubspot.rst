Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Why is website of a company not being updated from other connected systems?
***************************************************************************

In Hubspot the company field for **website** is read-only. That means that we can not write new domains into this field. 

If you want to change the domain name of a company, you should do it in HubSpot.

Why do I get company duplicates in HubSpot when I connect other systems?
************************************************************************

HubSpot does not have a unique identifier for companies that is safe enough to perform a merge of companies. In other words, we are unable to safely merge companies in HubSpot and duplicates might appear over time.

In case of duplicates in HubSpot, you can use the deduplication service on your HubSpot account to `merge records <https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/merge-records#:~:text=You%20can%20merge%20two%20companies,and%20associations%20from%20both%20records>`_.

.. note ::

    Remember that we **do not delete** data from your systems. You will need to manage deduplication in your other systems, if duplication accurs.

Why is the address of my contact in HubSpot not up to date?
***********************************************************

In Hubspot the contact field for **address** is read-only. That means that we can not write data into this field. 

If you want to change the address of a contact, you should do it in HubSpot.
