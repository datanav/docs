Why can I not see my CRM companies and contacts?
************************************************

Companies and contacts in CRM will only sync to PowerOffice if they are associated or involved with a closed/won deal.

Make sure that the companies and contacts you are trying to synchronise are not duplicated in PowerOffice.


Why contact person is not synched to PowerOffice?
*************************************************

Your contact person might already exist in PowerOffice, and is associated with another customer. We identify contacts by their emails, so if the email is the same as another contact person, the data will be merged, and you will not see your contact flow as you would expect.

.. Note ::

    Contact persons may have different names across systems. It is important to verify whether the contact you are attempting to synchronise shares the same email address as any other contact present in PowerOffice.

In PowerOffice a contact person can only be associatied with one customer at a time. That means that in order to associate this contact with another company, you need first to remove it from the customer he is currently associated with.

To delete a contact person association to a customer you can do the following:

#. Find the customer associated with your contact person
#. Click on **Contact Persons** on the left menu once on the customer card
#. Select the contact person you want to remove and click **Remove**

Why are my deleted HubSpot lineitems not deleted in PowerOffice order
*********************************************************************

Sesam Talk does not delete data in HubSpot and PowerOffice. This means that deleting lineitems in either of the systems will not be reflected in the other system.

To ensure data consistency, we recommend that you manually delete corresponding line items in both systems whenever adjustments are made to an order.
