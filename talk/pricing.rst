Pricing
=======

In this guide, we will provide you with detailed information about our pricing model, including the freemium plan and the , :ref:`Premium Plans<premium_plans>` .


Pricing Overview
----------------

Sesam Talk is designed to seamlessly synchronise data between connected services such as CRM, ERP, HRM and more. :ref:`See supported systems here<sesam_talk_systems>`. 

Our pricing model is based on the number of updates you perform per month. Updates are a key metric in determining your subscription plan's pricing.


.. admonition:: What is an Update?

	Before we dive into our pricing plans, let's clarify what we mean by an "update." 

	- **New Object Creation:** When you synchronise data for an object that does not exist in the target system, the creation of this object with all its properties counts as one update.

	- **Property Updates:** Once an object is already synchronised, any subsequent updates to its properties will count as single update, as long as they are saved at the same time.
