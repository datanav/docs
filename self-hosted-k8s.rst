Self-hosted on Kubernetes
=========================

.. Note::
   This is a draft document and is subject to change.

Introduction
------------

Sesam is offered as service that is either hosted for you in the cloud or you host it yourself. We generally
recommend the former, but there are scenarios where you would want to host it yourself. This document explains the
requirements and the installation steps necessary to get Sesam running on your Kubernetes cluster.

.. Note::
   Self hosted subscriptions are required to run the latest image of their chosen `software channel <https://docs.sesam.io/concepts.html#software-channels>`_.


Hardware requirements
---------------------

- Kubernetes cluster running version 1.22 or newer.
- One worker node with at least 8 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM.

Software requirements
---------------------

To be decided.
