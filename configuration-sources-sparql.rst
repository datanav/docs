SPARQL source
-------------

The SPARQL source fetches `RDF <https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/>`_ data about subjects from a
`triplestore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore>`_ exposing a `SPARQL compliant <https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/>`_ endpoint.
The endpoint of the source is configured either directly or implicitly by a :ref:`URL system <url_system>`. The source uses
two SPARQL queries to construct entities; the fragment query is a SPARQL ``SELECT`` query that gets a list of subjects
to get data for and their modification times and a fragment query, which is a SPARQL ``CONSTRUCT`` query that
gathers all relevant statements about a particular subject. The latter is then used to generate the stream of entities.

See the :doc:`rdf-support` document for more detail on working with RDF in Sesam.

Prototype

    {
        "type": "sparql",
        "system": "url-system-id",
        "url": "sparql-endpoint",
        "fragments_query": "SPARQL select query",
        "fragment_query": "SPARQL construct query"

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10, 10, 60, 10, 3

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description
     - Default
     - Req

   * - ``system``
     - String
     - The id of the :ref:`URL System <url_system>` component to use.
     -
     - Yes

   * - ``fragments_query``
     - List<String> or String
     - A SPARQL ``SELECT`` query that should return exactly two bound variables: ``id`` which should contain a unique subject
       and ``updated`` which should contain its modification time in ISO UTC format (or "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z" if not
       available in the data). If you would like the source to have continuation support, then you must include a filter based on the
       ``updated`` content compared to the current since moniker. You must use a variable expansion ``${since}`` for this
       purpose. The query result set should always be ordered by the "?updated" variable. If a list of strings is given,
       they will be converted to a single string by concatenation with the newline character.
     -
     - Yes

   * - ``fragment_query``
     - List<String> or String
     - A SPARQL ``CONSTRUCT`` query that should return all the relevant statements for a particular subject selected
       by the ``fragments_query`` query. The query should use the expansion variable "${uri}" to filter or select
       the correct subject to construct the statements to return.  If a list of strings is given, they will be
       converted to a single string by concatenation with the newline character.
     -
     - Yes

   * - ``initial_since_value``
     - String
     - A string literal to use when querying the triplestore the first time.
     - "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
     -

Continuation support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See the section on :ref:`continuation support <continuation_support>` for more information.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10, 80

   * - Property
     - Value

   * - ``supports_since``
     - ``false`` (Dynamic: ``true`` if ``${since}`` in ``fragments_query``)

   * - ``is_since_comparable``
     - ``true`` (Default)

   * - ``is_chronological``
     - ``false`` (Default)
