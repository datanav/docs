Microservices
=============

Introduction
------------
This section will help understand and implement the various Develop Extension Points available in Sesam through custom data sources, custom data transforms and custom data sinks. You will also learn how to build and use microservices for use inside Sesam instance.  

    .. tip::

        Microservices may help you increase your node's connectivity capabilities, but make sure that these aren't functionalities covered in the built-in Sesam functionalities already. Quite often people create microservices only to discover that either someone has already created one or that the desired functionality was already covered in the Sesam software. 

        There are a number of starter service implementations that can be copied and changed. These are open source and can be cloned from the `Sesam open source repository <https://www.github.com/sesam-community>`_.
