Microservices
=============

Introduction
------------
This section will help you build and use microservices inside your Sesam instance. 

    .. tip::

        Microservices may help you increase your node's connectivity capabilities, but make sure that these aren't functionalities covered in the built-in Sesam functionalities already. Quite often people create microservices only to discover that either someone has already created one or that the desired functionality was already covered in the Sesam software. 

        Sesam has a public git repository located `here <https://www.github.com/sesam-community>`_ where we publish microservices that we ourselves have found very useful.
