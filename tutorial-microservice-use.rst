Import to Sesam node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that the Docker image has been pushed to our Docker platform we need to spin up the container in our Sesam node.

Create a new system in your node. Choose **microservice prototype** as template. Give it a proper name. Inside the **"docker"** parameter write:

::

 "docker": {
    "image": "<docker_username>/<your_repository_name>:<tagname>",
    "port":5000
 }

    :align: center

Save it and click on **Status**. Click **Pull** and **restart**, then **Refresh** and **Check health**. You can also hit **Refresh** in the log so you see that it's running as it should.

The final step is to create an inbound pipe to get all the data from our microservice into Sesam datahub. Because our dataset does not have an **"_id"** property we need to add that. We could just use a normal **["add"]** function, but as you can see from the microservice, weâ€™ve actually just created one property as a dictionary. We really want these as three entities and that reason we use this function:

::

  ["create",
      ["apply", "create-entity", "_S.orders"]]

This creates a new rule where we can add the **"_id"**. Since the **"id"** in the microservice is an integer and Sesam only accepts string values for the **"_id"** we convert it with the **["string"]** function.
