Transit Encoding
================

Sesam's entity data model is a `JSON <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_ compatible data model. JSON itself supports a limited number of data types, so in order to make the model richer, the entity data model supports a subset of the `Transit <https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format>`_ data types. Transit encoding is a technique for encoding a larger set of data types in JSON. See the :ref:`entity data model <entity-data-model>` for more information about this encoding.
