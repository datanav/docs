Metrics and monitoring
======================

By enabling metrics and monitoring feature you will have access to a set of features that help you monitor your subscription. This bundle include features like custom notifications, insights and the metrics API.

How to enable
=============

Metrics and monitoring is now available for all subscriptions with clustered architecture. This is how you can activate the new feature:

- Login to the `Sesam portal <https://portal.sesam.io />`_

- Select the subscription you want to use

- Navigate to Subscription on the left menu

- Click on Products tab

- Click on “Enable Metrics and monitoring”


Pricing
=======

Follow the steps above to check how this feature affect your monthly price.

Metrics API
===========

This feature will make the ``/api/metrics`` endpoint available. This API endpoint exposes `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`_ compatible
metrics.

After enabling the feature, you will need to set up a prometheus database, then you can use tools, like Grafana, to create your own dashboards.

.. note::
   You need a JWT token with ``Admin`` role to be able to scrape the endpoint.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   curl -s -H "Authorization: bearer $JWT" "$SESAM_API_URL/metrics"


Note that all the counter metrics consists of two metrics suffixed by _counter and _created.

Monitoring
==========

Monitoring allows you to see pipe insights and set up custom pipe notifications.

Insights
--------

After enabling Metrics and monitoring, you can enable insights in the pipe you want to monitor. You will then have access to charts that show how many entities, errors and latencies there have been for the current pipe during the last 30 days.

To enable insights on a specific pipe:

- Navigate to the pipe you want to monitor
- Find the Insight tab
- Enable insights

.. important::
   Monitoring data collection will start only after you enable insights in a specific pipe.

Notifications
-------------

Add notification rules to pipes and get alerts when those rules are triggered. You can get notification alerts either in the user-interface or by email.

To see how to use custom notifications, please visit the :doc:`notification documentation <notifications-feature>`.
