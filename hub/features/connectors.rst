Connectors
==========

A connector is the collection of components required to synchronize one or more datatypes to a system. Connectors are built to be reused across solutions and functions as an adapter between an external system and Sesam. Connectors standardize and hides all the quirks of a system behind a facade.

For more information see the :ref:`connector documentation <connectors>`.
