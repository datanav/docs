Network Policy
==============

Sesam has the option of blocking all public access through it, or denying all access except for a whitelist of IP addresses and ranges. In the new architecture it is possible to push the IP white listing down to the reverse proxy. It also allows public access and restricted access to pipes through custom rules on the pipes. There are no restrictions on outgoing traffic.
