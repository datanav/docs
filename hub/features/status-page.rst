Status Page
===========

Sesam hosts a status page at `https://status.sesam.io/ <https://status.sesam.io/>`_. There you will find the real-time operational status of the Sesam services. Any incidents will be reported there, but you can also register and get emails for operational status changes. A notification badge will be shown in the :doc:`Sesam Management Studio <../management-studio>` when incidents occur. If you have other custom requirements there is also a provisional `Status API <https://status.sesam.io/api>`_ that can be used.
