Integrated Search
=================

Integrated data browsing gives you more insight into your data and the relationships within. Once enabled, globals are
indexed and available for free text search and navigation. Note that this incurs a 2x increase in data size needed for
global pipes.

Integrated Search is now available for all subscriptions with clustered architecture. This is how you can activate the new feature:

- Login to portal.sesam.io

- Select the subscription you want to use

- Navigate to Subscription on the left menu

- Click on Products tab

- Click on “Enable Integrated Search”

If your subscription is not yet on clustered architecture please contact support to start the migration.
