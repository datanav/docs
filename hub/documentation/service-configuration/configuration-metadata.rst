Service metadata
----------------

There is an optional special configuration entity used to represent
the service instance's metadata. The metadata is used to
specify properties that apply to the service instance itself. This
entity can either be added as a normal configuration entity, edited in
the UI or updated with the Service API.

Example:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "_id": "node",
      "type": "metadata",
      "namespaced_identifiers": true,
      "namespaces": {
         "default": {
           "example": "http://example.org/",
           "fifa": "http://www.fifa.com/"
         }
      },
      "global_defaults": {
         "use_signalling_internally": true,
         "default_compaction_type": "sink",
         "symmetric_namespace_collapse": false
      },
      "dependency_tracking": {
         "dependency_warning_threshold": 10000,
         "dependency_error_threshold": 50000,
         "dependency_warning_threshold_total_bytes": 33554432,
         "dependency_error_threshold_total_bytes": 134217728,
         "enable_hops_thresholds": true
      }
   }

Properties
----------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10, 10, 60, 10, 3

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description
     - Default
     - Req

   * - ``namespaced_identifiers``
     - Boolean
     - Flag used to enable namespaced identifers support for the service as a whole. Pipes inherit the value of the ``namespaced_identifiers`` property less explictly overridden.
     - ``false``
     -

   * - ``namespaces.default``
     - Dict
     - A dictionary of namespace to URI expansions. This expansion
       mapping is used to expand namespaced identifiers into fully
       qualified URIs, e.g. by those components that provide RDF
       support.

       A few expansion mappings come built-into the system. These
       are always available unless explicity overridden:

       .. code-block:: json

          "gs": "http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#",

     -
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_use_signalling_internally:

   * - ``global_defaults.use_signalling_internally``
     - Boolean
     - Flag used to globally enable signalling support between internal pipes (i.e. pipes that read from datasets and writes to datasets). If enabled, a pipe
       run is scheduled as soon as any of the input datasets changes (it does not interrupt any already running pipes).

       The default setting of this property is ``true`` which means
       signalling is enabled for all internal pipes in the
       installation. You can turn enable or disable this feature on individual pipes by setting the
       ``supports_signalling`` flag on the :ref:`dataset source
       <dataset_source_property_supports_signalling>`, :ref:`merge
       <merge_source_property_supports_signalling>`, :ref:`union datasets <union_source_property_supports_signalling>`
       and :ref:`merge datasets <merge_datasets_source_property_supports_signalling>` sources). This way you can also enable signalling on non-internal pipes.

       .. NOTE::

          Note that signalling support is "best-effort" only; signals
          are not persisted so delivery is not guaranteed. For this
          reason, pipes in such flows should always have
          :ref:`scheduled interval <pump_section>` as a "backup".

          If you set ``supports_signalling`` explicitly on the pipe source it will be enabled regardless of the pump schedule.

     - ``true``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_compaction_settings:

   * - ``global_defaults.default_compaction_type``
     - Enum<String>
     - Specifies the default compaction type. It can be set to ``"background"`` or ``"sink"``. Background compaction
       will run once every 24 hours. Sink compaction will normally run every time the pipe runs, but this can be
       tweaked with the ``global_defaults.compaction_interval`` setting.
     - ``"sink"``
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.compaction_interval``
     - Float
     - Specifies the default sink compaction interval. If this value is zero, sink compaction will run every time
       the pipe runs. If it is larger than zero, sink compaction will only run if at least
       ``compaction_interval`` seconds has passed since the last sink compaction. The use-case for this setting is
       to prevent pipes that run often from constantly trying to compact the sink-dataset.
     - ``0``
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.compaction_keep_versions``
     - Integer
     - The number of unique versions of an entity to keep around.
       The value must be greater than or equal to ``0``. If set to ``0`` then a time
       threshold must be set explicitly.

       .. WARNING::

          A value less than ``2`` means that dependency tracking is best effort only,
          and it will not be able to find all reprocessable entities. Do full or partial
          rescans as a counter measure.

     -
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.compaction_time_threshold_hours``
     - Integer
     - Specifies the threshold for how old entities must be before they are considered
       for compaction. This property is usually used when you want to keep entities
       around for a certain time.
     -
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.compaction_time_threshold_hours_pump``
     - Integer
     - Same as ``compaction_time_threshold_hours``, but applies to the pipe's pump
       execution dataset. Pump execution datasets are always trimmed by time.
     -
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.compaction_growth_threshold``
     - Float
     - The growth factor required for the automatically scheduled compaction to kick
       in. A value of ``1.1`` mean that there must have been 10% new offsets written to
       the dataset since the last compaction. ``1.0`` is the minimum value allowed.
     -
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.max_entity_bytes_size``
     - Integer
     - Defines the maximum size in bytes of an individual entity as it is stored in a dataset.
     - ``104857600`` (100MB)
     -

        .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_run_at_startup_if_not_populated:

   * - ``global_defaults.run_at_startup_if_not_populated``
     - Boolean
     - Specifies the default value of the property ``run_at_startup_if_not_populated`` for pumps.
     - ``false``
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.infer_pipe_entity_types``
     - Boolean
     - :ref:`Schema inference <schema_inference>` is enabled for
       all pipes by default. Setting the property to false will
       disable schema inference by default. Notice that one can
       also configure schema inference at the pipe level.
     - ``true``
     -

   * - ``global_defaults.use_config_circuit_breaker``
     - Boolean
     - When set to true, activates the circuit breaker for uploading configuration to the node. When activated, any changes to the node configuration that would result in the deletion of more than 10% of the existing components will not go through (this is the case only when the number of deleted components is also more than 10).
     - ``false``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_reprocessing_policy:

   * - ``global_defaults.reprocessing_policy``
     - Enum<String>
     - Specifies the default policy that pipes use to decide if the pipe needs to be reset or not. The policy can also be set on :ref:`individual pipes <automatic_reprocessing>`.

       - ``continue`` (the default) means that the pipe will continue processing input entities, and not reset the pipe, even though there might be factors indicating the the pipe should be reset.

       - ``automatic`` means that the pipe will automatically reset the pipe when it finds that there are factors that indicate that the pipe should be reset. The rationale for resetting the pipe is so that input entities can the reprocessed so that the output is correct.
     - ``continue``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_rescan_when_config_changes:

   * - ``global_defaults.rescan_when_config_changes``
     - Boolean
     - Specifies the default value of the pipes' ``rescan_when_config_changes`` property.
     - ``false``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_enable_background_rescan:

   * - ``global_defaults.enable_background_rescan``
     - Boolean
     - When set to true, enables running :ref:`pipe rescans <pipe_rescans>` in the background for all applicable pipes.
     - ``false``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_eager_load_microservices:

   * - ``global_defaults.eager_load_microservices``
     - Boolean
     - When set to false, Sesam can hold off starting up microservices which aren't connected to any pipes. Set to true to force all microservices to start up regardless.
     - ``true``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_symmetric_namespace_collapse:

   * - ``global_defaults.symmetric_namespace_collapse``
     - Boolean
     - When set to true, the expand and collapse features will be symmetrical, i.e. data containing namespaced identifiers read into Sesam will map to the same thing
       on the way out of Sesam. Note that setting this option to ``true`` as assumed by the DTL ``ni-collapse`` and ``ni-expand`` DTL functions
       will also alter the URI/NI collapse and expand behaviour of the RDF and SPARQL source and sink.
     - ``false``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_max_merged:

   * - ``global_defaults.max_merged``
     - Integer
     - Sets the maximum number of entities that can be merged at a time with pipes using the :ref:`merge source <merge_source>`.
       The pipes will fail if more than ``max_merged`` entities are attempted merged into a single entity.
       It is recommended to reduce this value to limit potential memory usage, as the merge pipe will use an excessive
       amount of RAM if the number of merged entities is too high.
     - ``50000``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_always_index_ids:

   * - ``global_defaults.always_index_ids``
     - Boolean
     - If enabled, :ref:`dataset sinks <dataset_sink>` will by default maintain an index for the ``$ids`` property.
       This is equivalent to setting ``"indexes": "$ids"`` on all dataset sinks in the node.
     - ``false``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_if_source_empty:

   * - ``global_defaults.if_source_empty``
     - Enum<String>
     - Determines the default behaviour of pipes when a source returns no entities. Normally, any previously synced
       entities will be deleted even if the pipe does not receive any entities from its source.
       If set to ``"fail"``,
       pipes will automatically fail if the source returns no entities. This means that any previous entities in the
       pipe's dataset are not deleted.
       If set to ``"accept"``, the pipe will *not* fail and any previously synced entities will be deleted.

       This property can be set on individual sources as well, in which case the source configuration will override the
       global default value.
     -
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_require_populated_input:

   * - ``global_defaults.require_populated_input``
     - Boolean
     - Determines the default behaviour of sources that reads from datasets when one or more of the datasets hasn't
       been populated. If set to ``true``, a pipe with such a source will only run if the dataset(s) the source
       reads from has been populated.
       This property can be set on individual sources as well, in which case the source configuration will override the
       global default value.
     - ``false``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_global_defaults_trace:

   * - ``global_defaults.trace``
     - Boolean or Object
     - This can be set to ``true`` to log the http requests and responses the :ref:`REST transform <rest_transform>`,
       :ref:`REST source <rest_source>`, :ref:`REST sink <rest_sink>` and :ref:`HTTP endpoint source <http_endpoint_source>`
       sends and receives. This information will be added to a "trace" property in the ``pump-completed`` and
       ``pump-failed`` events in the pipe execution log.
       By default the http headers and the first few bytes of the body is logged. If you need more fine-grained
       control of the logging, you can set ``trace`` to be an object and set the various ``trace.log_*``
       sub-properties (see below for a description of each sub-property).
     - ``false``
     - No

   * - ``global_defaults.trace.log_request_headers``
     - Boolean
     - If the ``trace`` property is an object this sub-property specifies if the request headers will
       be logged in the ``pump-completed``/``pump-completed`` events in the execution-log.
     - ``true``
     - No

   * - ``global_defaults.trace.log_request_body_maxsize``
     - Integer
     - If the ``trace`` property is an object this property specifies how many bytes of the request body should be
       logged in the ``pump-completed``/``pump-completed`` events in the execution-log.
     - 100
     - No

   * - ``global_defaults.trace.log_response_headers``
     - Boolean
     - If the ``trace`` property is an object this sub-property specifies if the response headers will
       be logged in the ``pump-completed``/``pump-completed`` events in the execution-log.
     - ``true``
     - No

   * - ``global_defaults.trace.log_response_body_maxsize``
     - Integer
     - If the ``trace`` property is an object this property specifies how many bytes of the response body should be
       logged in the ``pump-completed``/``pump-completed`` events in the execution-log.
     - 100
     - No

   * - ``global_defaults.trace.log_secret_redacted_bytes``
     - Integer
     - If the ``trace`` property is an object this property specifies how many bytes of each ``$SECRET`` will
       be redacted in the ``pump-completed``/``pump-completed`` events in the execution-log. The
       purpose of this setting is to redact enough of the secrets to render them safe to log, but to
       potentially leave some of the secret for debugging purposes.
       A value of ``-1`` means to redact all bytes of the secrets. Note that the redaction is only a best-effort
       attempt to prevent secrets from ending up in the logs, there may be cases where secrets leak through in any
       case, so it is best to always check that what ends up being logged looks ok.
     - 600
     - No

       .. _service_metadata_dependency_tracking_dependency_warning_threshold:

   * - ``dependency_tracking.dependency_warning_threshold``
     - Integer
     - The number of entities that dependency tracking can keep in memory at a given time. If this number is exceeded then a warning message is written to the log.
     - ``10000``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_dependency_tracking_dependency_error_threshold:

   * - ``dependency_tracking.dependency_error_threshold``
     - Integer
     - The number of entities that dependency tracking can keep in memory at a given time. If this number is exceeded then the pump will fail. Do not set this value too high as it may cause excessive memory usage.
     - ``50000``
     -

       .. _service_metadata_dependency_tracking_dependency_warning_threshold_total_bytes:

   * - ``dependency_tracking.dependency_warning_threshold_total_bytes``
     - Integer
     - The number of bytes that dependency tracking can keep in memory at a given time. If this number is exceeded then a warning message is written to the log.
     - ``33554432`` (32MB)
     -

       .. _service_metadata_dependency_tracking_dependency_error_threshold_total_bytes:

   * - ``dependency_tracking.dependency_error_threshold_total_bytes``
     - Integer
     - The number of bytes that dependency tracking can keep in memory at a given time. If this number is exceeded then the pump will fail.  Do not set this value too high as it may cause excessive memory usage.
     - ``134217728`` (128MB)
     -

       .. _service_metadata_dependency_tracking_enable_hops_thresholds:

   * - ``dependency_tracking.enable_hops_thresholds``
     - Boolean
     - If ``true``, then warning and error thresholds that apply for dependency tracking also apply for regular ``"hops"`` expressions. It is recommended that you set this property to ``true`` in development environments.
     - ``false``
     -
