.. _http_transform:

HTTP transform
--------------

This transform performs `HTTP POST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)>`_ requests to a HTTP capable
endpoint. The service at the endpoint then transforms the entities contained in the request body and returns them in
the `HTTP response message <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Response_message>`_ .

The HTTP endpoint must accept ``application/json`` and the response must also be ``application/json``.

The endpoint must support lists of entities only, i.e. it should expect to receive a
`JSON array <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ and it should always return a JSON array. If the endpoint returns
anything other than a "2xx Success" `HTTP status code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes>`_,
the transform will raise an exception.

The endpoint is free to decide how the entities are transformed. It'll just have to produce a list of zero or more
entities from the entities it was posted. This means that entities can be transformed, filtered out or new ones created.
