LDAP system
-----------

The LDAP system contains the configuration needed to communicate with a
`LDAP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>`_ system. It is used by
:ref:`LDAP sources <ldap_source>` to stream entities from LDAP catalogs.
Note that `Microsoft ActiveDirectory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory>`_ is also supported
through its LDAP-compatible interface/API.

It supports the following properties:

     - String
     - The fully qualified domain name (``FQDN``) of the LDAP host server. Note: do not use a URL on the form
       "ldap(s)://<host>:<port>" but use the ``host``, ``port`` and ``use_ssl`` properties separately instead.
     - "localhost"
     -

   * - ``port``
     - Integer
     - The TCP port of the LDAP service.
     - 389
     -

     - Indicates to the client whether to use a secure socket layer (``SSL``) or not when communicating with the LDAP service
     - false
     -

   * - ``use_ssl``
     - Boolean
     - If ``use_ssl`` is set to ``true`` then this property controls if the certificate used for the connection should be verified.
     - true
     -

   * - ``custom_ca_pem_chain``
     - String
     - If ``use_ssl`` is set to ``true`` this property can hold a chain of certificates (in PEM format) that
       should be used to verify the SSL connection.
     -
     -

   * - ``username``
     - String
     - The user to authenticate as against the LDAP service. If not set, no authentication will be attempted.

     - "latin-1"
     -

   * - ``connect_timeout``
     - Integer
     - Number of seconds to wait for connecting to the LDAP server before timing out.
