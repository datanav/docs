Make periodic entities from a versioned history pattern
-------------------------------------------------------

If a source provides a list of older versions of an entity, one way to materialize this is to convert them into periodic entities instead. This might make it easier to work with if your domain uses fixed periods for other purposes. One way to do this is to use the fixed periods as source and then for each period hop to the versioned dataset and join in the relevant version for this period.
