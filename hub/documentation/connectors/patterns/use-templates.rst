Use connector templates
=======================

The collect pipeline and the share pipes should all use their corresponding templates whenever possible, ``transform-collect-rest`` for the collect pipeline and ``transform-share-rest`` for the share pipes. This will allow the connector to benefit from improvements to these templates automatically.
