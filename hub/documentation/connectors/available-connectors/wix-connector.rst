Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Why are my ERP orders not created in Wix?
*************************************************

The Wix API does not allow general updates of orders, so we do not write any orders as we are not able to keep them in sync after creation.

We are looking into using the new Wix E-commerce API to provide this functionality in future releases.

How do I edit the API permissions?
************************************

If you want to edit the permissions in your API-key, please follow these steps:

#. On your Wix account. Open the `Wix API Keys Manager <https://manage.wix.com/account/api-keys>`_ .
#. Click the three dotted button on the API-key you want to edit.
#. Click **Edit**.
#. We suggest the following permissions: Under **All site permissions** choose **Wix Stores** and **Wix Contacts & Members**.
#. Click **Save & Close**
