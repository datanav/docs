The Pump Execution Dataset
==========================

The pump execution dataset is a log which contains entities with
information about a particular pump's execution history. The dataset
id is computed from the pump's ``_id`` property as
``system:pump_execution:<pump_id>``.

.. WARNING::

   The pump execution entities are subject to change. Their ids and
   structure may be changed in the future. The dataset is not meant
   to be a public API that applications can use.

It will always contain at least two entities for each time the pump
runs. The first will have the id "pump-started" and the last either
"pump-ended" *or* "pump-completed". In between these entities,
there may be entities recording read errors and/or write
errors. Other informational entities such as "pump-enabled"/"pump-disabled" or "pipe-offset-set" may also be present.
The entities will also contain a ``tokens`` property if :ref:`custom authentication <rest_custom_auth>` or
:ref:`OAuth2 authentication <url_system_oauth2>` is used on any systems that the pipe uses. This property exposes
expiry dates for any tokens that the systems are using.

Depending on the pump settings, the write errors can then be
retried one or more times during the next runs.

The pump-started entity
-----------------------

The "pump-started" is written to the pump execution dataset when the pump has started, but before any other processing
takes place.

       version of a entity comes from the source while there also exist a previously failed version in the
       execution dataset. In this case, if the new version is successfully written to the sink a new write-error entity
       is written to the log for this entity, but marked as not retryable (i.e ``false`` value) so it can be skipped
       during retries.

     - Boolean
     - A flag indicating if the entity has been given up on, for example having exceeded some number of retries. If a
       dead letter dataset is specified for the pump, the "dead" entity will be written there and a final "write-error"
       entity written to the execution with the ``dead`` flag set to ``true``. This entity will then never be retried
       again (until a new version comes along from the source).

   * - ``resolved_entity``
     - Object
     - A complete embedded copy of the entity that resolved the write-error if it was retried (and if it differs from
       ``entity``). This property will only be set if ``resolved`` is also ``true``.

     - String
     - Information about from the pump failure. It a stack trace of the execution failure.

   * - ``original_traceback``

     - String
     - Same as the traceback, but only the root message itself.
