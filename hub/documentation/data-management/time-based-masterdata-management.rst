Time-based masterdata management in Sesam
=========================================

Summary
-------

Time-based master data management ensures that the most recently updated system becomes the master of a property, rather than assigning a specific system as the master for a given property. This approach is useful when no single system can be designated as the master for a particular type of data. In practice, it's often more important to have the latest version of the data—such as an employee's phone number or a customer's email address—regardless of which system it comes from. If a customer updates their phone number in one system, you don't want an outdated number from another system to override it. Time-based master data management always selects the most recent update as the master value, regardless of the source system.

This section covers best practices in how to implement time-based masterdata management in Sesam and the effects is has.

Last modified value
-------------------

In order to do time-based masterdata management, every property needs a datetime corresponding to the date and time the property was last modified. In Sesam, the preferred way of implementing this to introduce :ref:`claims <claims>`, a claim is a collection of metadata for each property. 

We can now rewrite the key-value ``<property>: <value>`` as ``<property>: <claim>`` where the claim is a dictionary containing the claim data. In the example below, the claim contains the property's value, its $last-modified datetime, and the claim's end-time, which is when the claim got replaced by a newer claim. These are the ``claim properties``.

|start-h3| Example |end-h3|

::

  "<namespace>:<property>": 
    {
      "<namespace>:value": "value",
      "<namespace>:$last-modified": "~t1987-09-11:T06:55:07.456827Z",
      "<namespace>:end-time": "~t2024-09-20T07:18:20.698042Z"
    }

Not every system has last modified datetime values for each property. Some systems might only have a datetime value on the entity as a whole, while some systems might not have any datetime value. In all three cases we need to be able to supply the claim with a near real-time datetime value in order to perform accurate time-based masterdata management. The different scenarios are described below in order of priority:

1. The system provides last modified datetime values for each individual property

  * In this case the system provided datetime values are directly added to each corresponding claim's ``$last-modified`` value

2. The system provides last modified datetime values for each entity

  * In this case we use the provided datetime value as the initial ``$last-modified`` but manually update the ``$last-modified`` value when the claim value changes 

3. The system does not provides any last modified datetime values on property or entity level

  * In this case we use Sesam's internal ``_ts`` value from the ``-collect`` pipe as initial $last-modified value and manually update the ``$last-modified`` value when the claim value changes 


A full DTL example on how to set and update $last-modified values in claims can be seen at the bottom of this page.

Masterdata management
---------------------

Now that we have up-to-date datetime values inside each property claim we can perform time-based masterdata management inside our :ref:`global pipes <whatis-global>`. Instead of using the :ref:`coalesce function <coalesce_dtl_function>` to set system priority we can sort claims by the newest ``$last-modified`` value and pick that claim value corresponding to the newest claim.

The example above also handles old claims and makes sure that the new claim value is actually more current than the old one.
