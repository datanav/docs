Data Modelling
==============

Data modelling is the core of any platform aimed to integrate data. Sesam has spent many years creating a data modelling framework specifically to ensure efficient and continuously updated dataflows while ensuring high quality results, as well as maintaining the data integrity of each source system's data. Sesam's data modelling framework also enables scalable and reusable configurations, thereby minimizing supplementary efforts along the road. 

In this section we will show you both how single data entities are modelled in Sesam, as well as the modelling of the dataflows that utilizes them.
