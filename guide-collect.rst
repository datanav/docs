Collect
=======

Introduction
------------
This guide will help you learn and apply Sesam's :ref:`collect patterns <collect-pattern>`.

The collect patterns consist of multiple aspects concerned with how to utilise Sesam optimally at this step in a :ref:`Sesam dataflow <creating-a-sesam-dataflow>`. 

You will now be guided through these in chronological stepwise tutorials provided below.

After you have completed these tutorials you will have:

#. Learned about Sesam's different source systems
#. Have created an inbound pipe
#. Made required data transformation in your recently created inbound pipe
#. Configured its pump and verified a populated sink
#. Tested data change tracking
#. Learned about Sesam's generic data model
#. Applied :ref:`continuation support <concepts-continuation-support>`
