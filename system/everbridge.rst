Everbridge
==========
Everbridge software automates the key steps for responding to a critical event. It aggregates threat data from third party and internal sources so customers can assess risk, and locate people and assets at risk and those needed to respond. It then enables customers to act by executing pre-defined processes based on the type of threat for who should be contacted and how, what message to send, and who to escalate to if a responder is not available.
