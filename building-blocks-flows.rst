Flows
=====

:ref:`Pipes <concepts-pipes>` read from sources and writes to sinks. The output of one pipe can be read by many downstream pipes. In this way pipes can be chained together into a directed graph â€“ also called a flow. In some special situations you may also have cycles in this graph. The Sesam Management Studio has features for :ref:`visualising and inspecting flows <management-studio-flows>`.
