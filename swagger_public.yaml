        - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        - multipart/form-data
      description: |
        Runs some operation on the pump. The operation is specified by the 'operation' form parameter in the request.

        The following operations exists:

          "start":

              Starts a new run of the pump. A pump is typically run automatically at scheduled intervals, but with this
              operation a pump can be started manually.

          "stop":

              Stops the pump, if it is running. If the pump is not already running, this operation has no effect.

          "enable":

              Enables the pump. This means that the pump can be run automatically by the system (usually on some fixed
              schedule).

          "disable":

              Disables the pump. This means that the pump cannot be run automatically by the system. Note that it is
              still possible to start the pump manually with the "start"-operation.

          .. _api-reference-pump-update-last-seen:

          "update-last-seen":

              Updates the "last-seen" value of the pump. This is the value the pump uses to figure out at which point
              in the source-data it stopped at its last run. The format of the "last-seen" form parameter depends on
              the source-system. It could be a date, and it could be some opaque binary value.

              To clear the "last-seen" value of the pump, set the "last-seen" form parameter to an empty string. This
              will make the pump behave as if it was running for the first time. This is useful in cases where one
              wants to reprocess the data from scratch for some reason.

          "set-last-seen-to-end":

              Updates the "last-seen" value of the pump such that the pump thinks that it has seen all the source-data.
              Not all source-types supports this operation.
              NOTE: Doing this may result in data-loss, since any unread entities in the source will not be read. But
              it is sometimes useful during development and testing; for instance when one has a huge existing
              source-dataset, but only want to run the pipe against new entities.

          "reset-tracking" (EXPERIMENTAL):

              Resets the dependency tracking so that it will continue starting from the end of dependent datasets.

              Note that tracking will continue from what is the end of the datasets at the point in time when the pump
              runs, not the time at which this call is made.

              Note that dependency tracking will then be skipped for untracked offsets, causing the output to be
              potentially incorrect. Use this feature only during development, or when you intend to do a full sync
              soon after the reset.
