# Styleguide

## Referencing figures and pictures

The pictures or diagrams you add need to be named to match the information
they contain.
As an example this picture is about the ESB and is named accordingly.

It is also the second figure in the topic where it is referenced, so the
alternative text is prefixed with the numbering "Figure 2".

```reStructuredText
.. figure:: ./media/Enterprise_Service_Bus.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Figure – Enterprise Service Bus

   Figure – Enterprise Service Bus
```

## Insertion of Code

```reStructuredText
.. code-block:: json
   {
     "<key>": "<value>"
   }

   {
     "postCode": "6400"
   }
```

## Inline DTL/Config references

All references to these must be enclosed with \`\`
* \`\`some-dataset\`\`
* \`\`some-pipe\`\`
* \`\`some-system\`\`
* \`\`some-DTL-function\`\`
* \`\`some-entity-attribute\`\`

RST example:
```reStructuredText
The pipe ``person`` reads from the system ``system`` and produces
the dataset ``person`` where entities contain the attribute ``_id`` which
is created by using the function ``add``.
```

## `.. _seealso:` At the end of topics

At the end of each topic you should link to all topics referenced in the
text and all relevant topics.

This example comes from the topic "Globals as a concept".
```reStructuredText
.. seealso::

  Architecture Beginner - Next topic: :ref:`special-sesam-attributes-1-1`

  Architecture Novice: :ref:`full-outer-join-merge-1-2`, :ref:`left-join-hops-1-2`, :ref:`global-1-2`

  Architecture Intermediate: :ref:`hops-1-3`, :ref:`subset-1-3`

  DTL Novice: :ref:`merge-as-a-source-3-2`, :ref:`hops-3-2`

  DTL Intermediate: :ref:`source-subset-3-3`
```

By using the `:ref:` syntax the name of the topic will replace the reference,
for example
```reStructuredText
DTL Intermediate: :ref:`source-subset-3-3`
```
is converted into: `DTL Intermediate: Source Subset`

## Inline links to other topics

Inline links to other topics can be done by using the `:ref:` syntax which
is as follows:
```reStructuredText
More on :ref:`special-sesam-attributes_rdf-type` in the next topic :ref:`special-sesam-attributes-1-1`.
```

## Title and headers syntax in RST.
```

# General Setup

## File structure

```
File structure overview. Structure is the same for each chapter.

docs/
-training/
--010_architecture_and_concepts/
---architecture_and_concepts.rst #index file
---020_Beginner.rst
---030_Novice.rst
---040_Intermediate.rst
---050_Advanced.rst              #Not present in all chapters
---060_Expert.rst                #Not present in all chapters
---070_Epilogue.rst
---media/
----beginner-different_types_of_architecture_ESB.png
----novice-joining_data-Left_join.png
----<difficulty>-<sub_chapter>-<image_name>.png
--020_systems/
---media/
---… same structure as 010_architecture_and_concepts.
```

## How is the table of contents generated?
The structure is generated by the following hierarchy of "toctree" index files:

```
hierarchy:

index.rst
training/
-training.rst
-010_architecture_and_concepts/
--architecture_and_concepts.rst
```
`index.rst` references `training.rst`.

`training.rst` references each chapters rst, f.ex: `architecture_and_concepts.rst`

`architecture_and_concepts.rst` contains an introduction and references the rst files in that chapter.

All topics in a chapter will be shown in the main Table of Contents, meaning titles where `-----` is used. (this can be changed by setting depth in the `training.rst` index file.)

## How does numbering work?
Numbering is added in post as the docs page is generated. We use the toctree flag :numbered: in training.rst to enable this.
