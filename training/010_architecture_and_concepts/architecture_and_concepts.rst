.. rubric:: Introduction

Sesam opens the door to running a data-driven business, but what is a
data driven business and how does the journey towards it look?

In this chapter we will introduce you to Sesam as a way of not only
developing but thinking. You will learn about overarching themes for
designing integrations, the components you build with and the pitfalls
to look out for along the way.

After reading you can expect to recognize and design a data driven
Integration of your own.
