Joining Data

The value of joining data

Short overview of what data joining is

1-1, 1-n, n-m

.. _make-namespaced-identifiers-for-foreign-keys-make-ni-1-2:

Make namespaced identifiers for foreign keys - make-ni
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Continuing along the lines of joining data, namespaced identifiers (NI's) come into play. NI's are used in Sesam to create unique identifiers inside one Sesam datahub. In order to create them, you can use either of the two functions: ["make-ni"] or ["ni"].

In the below example, ["make-ni"] will be used. A NI in Sesam works like a foreign key in a relational database. As such, it shows the relation between data objects and enables the joining of these. The pipe config presented in the below example, shows exactly this:  

.. code-block:: json

	{
	  "_id": "mssql-accounts",
	  "type": "pipe",
	  "source": {
	    "type": "sql",
	    "system": "sesam-training",
	    "table": "accounts"
	  },
	  "transform": {
	    "type": "dtl",
	    "rules": {
	      "default": [
	        ["copy", "*"],
	        ["add", "rdf:type",
	          ["ni", "mssql-accounts", "accounts"]
	        ],
	        ["make-ni", "mssql-contacts", "phone"]
	      ]
	    }
	  }
	}

and will result in the following dataset when run. For the purpose of spacing, only one entity is shown:

.. code-block:: json

	{
	  "mssql-accounts:country": "DK",
	  "mssql-accounts:id": 40,
	  "mssql-accounts:phone": "1-894-115-3398",
	  "mssql-accounts:phone-ni": "~:mssql-contacts:1-894-115-3398",
	  "mssql-accounts:position": "CEO",
	  "rdf:type": "~:mssql-accounts:accounts"
	}


As can be seen in the above dataset, the property with the key: "mssql-accounts:phone-ni" is the result of the function ["make-ni"] as defined in the above pipe config. The value can be used to join data between the pipes: "mssql-accounts" and "mssql-contacts" so that data can be merged to create complete representations of a related set of data objects. In Sesam, a merge is typically done on different datasets in the global stage of data modelling.

Write about where globals fit into the bigger picture of data flows, how

.. _filter-entities-on-the-way-out-1-2:

Filter entities on the way out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Filter gives the ability to stop entities from being sent by providing
  a logical gate.
| On the other hand, it can make sure you only send the entities you
  wish to receive in an endpoint.

| Makes sure the endpoint only receives the entities they want.
| Can stop entities from triggering events they shouldn’t trigger.

| + + many examples
| filtering on source data
| on target data (from hops f.ex) – typical example, hop to
  global-classification and map status, if cancelled then filter

.. _customize-data-structure-for-endpoints-1-2:

Customize data structure for endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Sesam has transformative functions to add, remove,Copy the attributes
  you want the end system to receive.
| All changes to attributes you add to the target will cause an entity
  update.

Referring to namespace 1.1.15 to know property origin, rename, add, copy

.. _change-tracking-data-delta-1-2:

Change tracking & data delta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`All entities stored inside sesam have a
\_hash <https://docs.sesam.io/entitymodel.html?highlight=_hash>`__
value. This is a quantification of an entity and is calculated every
time an entity is processed by a pipe. If the \_hash value changes or is
new, the entity will be stored as a new version in dataset. We call this
change in \_hash value a data-delta.

Any data-delta for an entity in a dataset causes downstream pipes to see
this as a new sequence number they haven’t yet read. This in turn makes
the pipe process the entity. If the processed entity does not exist or
gets a new \_hash in the output of the pipe, it will cause an update to
the output dataset.
