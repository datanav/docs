.. _joining-data-1-2:

Joining Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The value of joining data

Short overview of what data joining is

1-1, 1-n, n-m

.. _make-namespaced-identifiers-for-foreign-keys-make-ni-1-2:

Make namespaced identifiers for foreign keys - make-ni
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _full-outer-join-merge-1-2:

Full outer Join - Merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All data from input ends up in output


.. _left-join-hops-1-2:

Left Join - Hops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data is appended to the output

.. _global-1-2:

Global
~~~~~~

Golden – the best truth about common attributes of a concept collected
from multiple sources

Coalesce, prioritization of source data (master data)


.. _generic-input-pipes-custom-output-pipes-1-2:

Generic input pipes, custom output pipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write about where globals fit into the bigger picture of data flows, how
do pipes going in look and how do pipes going out look?

.. _filter-entities-on-the-way-out-1-2:

Filter entities on the way out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Filter gives the ability to stop entities from being sent by providing
  a logical gate.
| On the other hand, it can make sure you only send the entities you
  wish to receive in an endpoint.

| Makes sure the endpoint only receives the entities they want.
| Can stop entities from triggering events they shouldn’t trigger.

| + + many examples
| filtering on source data
| on target data (from hops f.ex) – typical example, hop to
  global-classification and map status, if cancelled then filter

.. _tag-your-entities-categorization-of-sub-concepts-1-2:

Tag your entities - Categorization of sub-concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra:type - usually added into the globals to separate what entities about the same thing do & mean.

.. _customize-data-structure-for-endpoints-1-2:

Customize data structure for endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Sesam has transformative functions to add, remove,Copy the attributes
  you want the end system to receive.
| All changes to attributes you add to the target will cause an entity
  update.

Referring to namespace 1.1.15 to know property origin, rename, add, copy

.. _change-tracking-data-delta-1-2:

Change tracking & data delta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`All entities stored inside sesam have a
\_hash <https://docs.sesam.io/entitymodel.html?highlight=_hash>`__
value. This is a quantification of an entity and is calculated every
time an entity is processed by a pipe. If the \_hash value changes or is
new, the entity will be stored as a new version in dataset. We call this
change in \_hash value a data-delta.

Any data-delta for an entity in a dataset causes downstream pipes to see
this as a new sequence number they haven’t yet read. This in turn makes
the pipe process the entity. If the processed entity does not exist or
gets a new \_hash in the output of the pipe, it will cause an update to
the output dataset.
