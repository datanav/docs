The value of joining data

Short overview of what data joining is

1-1, 1-n, n-m

Full outer Join - Merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All data from input ends up in output


.. _left-join-hops-1-2:

Left Join - Hops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to a full outer join it is also relevant to talk about the left join. This is because you in the Sesam terminology will use something we call "hops". The hops is similar to a left join, in that it appends data and returns data even if there are no matches for a particular entry in the join. As such, in cases where you append data, null values in Sesam are retained. A graphical representation of the left join can be viewed in the below figure:

.. figure:: ./media/Left_Join.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Figure – Left Join

   Figure – Left Join

To illustrate the graphical representation of a left join, the following practical example has been drafted:

.. code-block:: json
	
	{
	  "_id": "first_entity:foo",
	  "first_entity:value": 1,
	  "first_entity:string":"Hello merge",
	  "first_entity:values": [1, 2, 4, 5]
	}
	{			
	  "_id": "second_entity:bar",
	  "second_entity:value": 1,
	  "second_entity:string":"This is retained",
	  "second_entity:values": [1, 3, 4, 6]
	}
	{			
	  "_id": "third_entity:the_runt",
	  "third_entity:value": 1,
	  "third_entity:string":"Third's the charm"
	}

When applying the hops, our point of reference will be the first data object from the above and we will name the new property "left_join_result". We will choose to join the data on the value property present in all of the above three data objects in order to return the values property. Albeit, the values property is only present on the first two data objects. The expected result can be seen below:

.. code-block:: json

	{
	  "_id": "first_entity:foo",
	  "first_entity:value": 1,
	  "first_entity:string":"Hello merge",
	  "first_entity:values": [1, 2, 4, 5],
	  "first_entity:left_join_result": [{"second_entity:values": [1, 3, 4, 6], null}]
	}

As stated earlier, it is important to note that in this case, null values will be returned if the hops is not possible between individual data objects, which can be seen in the new property "left_join_result", where the last entry is null.  

.. _global-1-2:

Global
~~~~~~

Golden – the best truth about common attributes of a concept collected
from multiple sources

Coalesce, prioritization of source data (master data)


.. _generic-input-pipes-custom-output-pipes-1-2:

Generic input pipes, custom output pipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write about where globals fit into the bigger picture of data flows, how
do pipes going in look and how do pipes going out look?

.. _filter-entities-on-the-way-out-1-2:

Filter entities on the way out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Filter gives the ability to stop entities from being sent by providing
  a logical gate.
| On the other hand, it can make sure you only send the entities you
  wish to receive in an endpoint.

| Makes sure the endpoint only receives the entities they want.
| Can stop entities from triggering events they shouldn’t trigger.

| + + many examples
| filtering on source data
| on target data (from hops f.ex) – typical example, hop to
  global-classification and map status, if cancelled then filter

.. _tag-your-entities-categorization-of-sub-concepts-1-2:

Tag your entities - Categorization of sub-concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra:type - usually added into the globals to separate what entities about the same thing do & mean.

.. _customize-data-structure-for-endpoints-1-2:

Customize data structure for endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Sesam has transformative functions to add, remove,Copy the attributes
  you want the end system to receive.
| All changes to attributes you add to the target will cause an entity
  update.

Referring to namespace 1.1.15 to know property origin, rename, add, copy

.. _change-tracking-data-delta-1-2:

Change tracking & data delta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`All entities stored inside sesam have a
\_hash <https://docs.sesam.io/entitymodel.html?highlight=_hash>`__
value. This is a quantification of an entity and is calculated every
time an entity is processed by a pipe. If the \_hash value changes or is
new, the entity will be stored as a new version in dataset. We call this
change in \_hash value a data-delta.

Any data-delta for an entity in a dataset causes downstream pipes to see
this as a new sequence number they haven’t yet read. This in turn makes
the pipe process the entity. If the processed entity does not exist or
gets a new \_hash in the output of the pipe, it will cause an update to
the output dataset.
