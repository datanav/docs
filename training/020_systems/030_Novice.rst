Systems as a pipe source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: Summary

  Systems as a pipe source...

  - should provide streams of entities as input to the pipes they are connected to
  - can provide entities with **any** shape
  - must provide Sesam with a unique identifier called ``_id``

Using a system as a pipe source defines the possibilities this pipe has when
pulling data. Sesam supports implementing multiple different `system types <https://docs.sesam.io/configuration.html#systems>`_, i.e: JSON, SQL, microservice etc. Each system, regardless of type, will have a defined set of implementation functionalities which can be set in its DTL configuration. As such, the intended usage in Sesam should be taken into consideration when implementing a System.

When a system is used as a pipe source, certain aspects come into consideration. Namely, that a `source <https://docs.sesam.io/configuration.html#sources>`_ should provide streams of entities as input to the pipes it is connected to. The entities that are provided can take any shape, i.e: they can have nested dictionaries. The only required property for entities within Sesam is the ``_id`` which is used as a unique identifier.

Systems as a pipe sink
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same as above only with system as a sink. What is a system in the
context of a sink? What does the pipe see? What does the system see?

| Default authentication methods built in for systems handling URLS
  $SECRET()
| Basic, Oauth2, JWT, microservices

| Authentication methods for specific systems: ?? worth mentioning
| SQL, oracle

#. *What does a system as a pipe source provide?*

#. *What should you consider when using systems as a pipe sink?*

#. *Does Sesam support different authentication methods?*

#. *Why should you familiarize yourself with system types in Sesam?*

#. *Pick a system type:* 
  
      Make your system run in Sesam

      Use your system both as a pipe source and a pipe sink
