Systems as a pipe source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: Summary

  Systems as a pipe source...

  - should provide streams of entities as input to the pipes they are connected to
  - can provide entities with **any** shape
  - must provide Sesam with a unique identifier called ``_id``

Using a system as a pipe source defines the possibilities this pipe has when
pulling data. Sesam supports implementing multiple different `system types <https://docs.sesam.io/configuration.html#systems>`_, i.e: JSON, SQL, microservice etc. Each system, regardless of type, will have a defined set of implementation functionalities which can be set in its DTL configuration. As such, the intended usage in Sesam should be taken into consideration when implementing a System.

When a system is used as a pipe source, certain aspects come into consideration. Namely, that a `source <https://docs.sesam.io/configuration.html#sources>`_ should provide streams of entities as input to the pipes it is connected to. The entities that are provided can take any shape, i.e: they can have nested dictionaries. The only required property for entities within Sesam is the ``_id`` which is used as a unique identifier.

Systems as a pipe sink
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same as above only with system as a sink. What is a system in the
context of a sink? What does the pipe see? What does the system see?
