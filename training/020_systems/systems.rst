.. rubric:: Introduction

In this chapter you will learn about Systems; the component which
connects Sesam to the external world. They are an integral component of
Sesam and have a wide array of uses, so we will start off by introducing

Onwards you will learn how Systems interface with Pipes and how to use
customized solutions when Sesams built-in systems cannot.
