.. _json_source:

JSON source
-----------


The JSON source can read entities from a `JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ resource available over
`HTTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol>`_ (i.e. served by a web server).
The service must conform to the :doc:`JSON Pull Protocol <json-pull>`.

Consider using the more general :ref:`REST source <rest_source>` if you're interacting with a non-Sesam JSON capable
REST api.

If the ``supports_since`` property is set to *true*, then the ``since`` request parameter is added to the URL to
signal that we want only changes that happened after the since marker.

Prototype
^^^^^^^^^

::

    {
       "system": "system-id",
       "type": "json",
       "url": "url-to-json-data",
       "supports_signalling": false,
       "headers": {
           "some-header": "some-value"
       }
    }

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10, 10, 60, 10, 3

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description
     - Default
     - Req

   * - ``system``
     - String
     - The id of the :ref:`URL system <url_system>` or :ref:`microservice system <microservice_system>` component to use.
     -
     - Yes

   * - ``url``
     - String
     - The URL of the ``JSON`` data to load. Note that the data must conform to the :doc:`JSON Pull Protocol <json-pull>`.
     -
     - Yes

   * - ``supports_signalling``
     - Boolean
     - Flag used to enable or disable signalling support between internal pipes (dataset to dataset pipes). If enabled, a pipe
       run is scheduled as soon as the input dataset(s) changes. It does not interrupt any already running pipes.
     - ``false``
     -

   * - ``page_size``
     - Integer(>=1)
     - If the page size is specified then the source will download the data across multiple requests until there is no more data left to download. The ``limit`` request parameter is passed to the endpoint to cap the number of entities in each response.

       .. NOTE::

          Paging is only available if the source has ``supports_since``, ``is_chronological`` and ``is_since_comparable`` all set to ``true``.
     - No paging
     -

   * - ``subset``
     - Array
     - | An ``eq`` DTL expression where the left hand side is the index expression and the right hand side is the value that represents the subset. If the subset is specified then only entities that are in that subset will be read from the source.
       |
       | Example: ``["eq", "_S.category", "tank"]``

       .. NOTE:: For this to work the source must support subsets.
     -
     - No

   * - ``headers``
     - Dict<String,String>
     - A optional set of header values to set in HTTP request made using this source. Both keys and values must
       evaluate to strings.
     -
     -

Continuation support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See the section on :ref:`continuation support <continuation_support>` for more information.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10, 80

   * - Property
     - Value

   * - ``supports_since``
     - ``false`` (Default)

   * - ``is_since_comparable``
     - ``true`` (Default)

   * - ``is_chronological``
     - ``false`` (Default)

Example configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The outermost object would be your :ref:`pipe <pipe_section>` configuration, which is omitted here for brevity:

::

    {
        "source": {
            "type": "json",
            "system": "some-url-or-microservice-system",
            "url": "test.json",
        }
    }
