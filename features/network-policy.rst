Network Policy
==============

One has the option of blocking all public access through it or denying all except for a whitelist of ip addresses and ranges. In the new architecture it is possible to push the IP white listing down to the reverse proxy and also allow public access and restricted access to pipes through custom rules on the pipes. There are no restrictions on outgoing traffic currently.
