Cron expressions
================

Cron expressions encode a repeating interval of time. The format
supported by the pump machinery of the Sesam node is explained in more
detail below. It mostly follows the explanation here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron but note that the special characters
``W`` and ``#`` are not supported by our implementation.

.. NOTE::

   Cron expressions are evaluated in the `UTC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time>`_ timezone.
