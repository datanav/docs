Concepts
========
The overall data landscape is constantly evolving. With this evolution follows a vast collection of concepts and definitions that may deviate between frameworks or genres. 
Unless we can define exactly what a concept means in specific situation misunderstandings are bound to happen.

In this section we will explain the most central concepts used in Sesam. Many of these concepts exists outside Sesam too, but perhaps with slightly different functionalities. 

.. _whatis-global:

Global
------

A global is a collection of merged data types that can be mapped to a global namespace.

.. _whatis-global-model:

Global model
------------

A global model is the collection of globals and their global properties as defined in the global namespace.

.. _whatis-datatype:

Datatype
--------

Typically represents one concept within a system, e.g. customers in a CRM system.

.. _whatis-connector:

Connector
---------

A connector is the collection of components required to synchronize one or more datatypes to a system.

.. _whatis-namespaces:

Namespaces
----------
A namespace 

Namespaces is how Sesam manages to know where properties originate from. It allows us to merge data from multiple sources without losing context.
