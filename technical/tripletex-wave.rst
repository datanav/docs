Tripletex Contact to Wave Customer person
-----------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Tripletex Contact and a Wave Customer person must be established.

A new Wave Customer person will be created from a Tripletex Contact if it is connected to a Tripletex Order, Invoice, or Orderline that is synchronized into Wave.

A Tripletex Contact will merge with a Wave Customer person if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Contact Property
     - Wave Customer person Property
   * - email
     - email

Once a link between a Tripletex Contact and a Wave Customer person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Tripletex Contact and a Wave Customer person:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

Tripletex Employee to Wave Customer person
------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Tripletex Employee and a Wave Customer person must be established.

A Tripletex Employee will merge with a Wave Customer person if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Employee Property
     - Wave Customer person Property
   * - email
     - email

Once a link between a Tripletex Employee and a Wave Customer person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Tripletex Employee and a Wave Customer person:
