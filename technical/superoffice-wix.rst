SuperOffice Person to Wix Contacts
----------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a SuperOffice Person and a Wix Contacts must be established.

A new Wix Contacts will be created from a SuperOffice Person if it is connected to a SuperOffice Quoteline, or Quotealternative that is synchronized into Wix.

A SuperOffice Person will merge with a Wix Contacts if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - SuperOffice Person Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
   * - Emails.Value
     - primaryInfo.email

Once a link between a SuperOffice Person and a Wix Contacts is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.
