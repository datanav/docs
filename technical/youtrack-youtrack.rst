YouTrack Hubprojects to Youtrack Hubprojects
--------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a YouTrack Hubprojects and a Youtrack Hubprojects must be established.

A YouTrack Hubprojects will merge with a Youtrack Hubprojects if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - YouTrack Hubprojects Property
     - Youtrack Hubprojects Property
   * - id
     - id

Once a link between a YouTrack Hubprojects and a Youtrack Hubprojects is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a YouTrack Hubprojects and a Youtrack Hubprojects:

.. list-table::
