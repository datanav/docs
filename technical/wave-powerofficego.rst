Wave Customer person to Powerofficego Contactperson
---------------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer person and a Powerofficego Contactperson must be established.

A Wave Customer person will merge with a Powerofficego Contactperson if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer person Property
     - Powerofficego Contactperson Property
   * - email
     - emailAddress

Once a link between a Wave Customer person and a Powerofficego Contactperson is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wave Customer person and a Powerofficego Contactperson:

.. list-table::
