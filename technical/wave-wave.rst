This technical document provides a detailed overview of the Sesam Talk data flow from Wave to Wave. It serves as a QA checklist for testing purposes and is the intellectual property of Sesam.io AS.

Wave Customer to Wave Customer
------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer and a Wave Customer must be established.

A Wave Customer will merge with a Wave Customer if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer Property
     - Wave Customer Property
   * - email
     - email

Once a link between a Wave Customer and a Wave Customer is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wave Customer and a Wave Customer:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer Property
     - Wave Customer Property
     - Wave Data Type

Wave Customer to Wave Customer
------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer and a Wave Customer must be established.

A new Wave Customer will be created from a Wave Customer if it is connected to a Wave Vendor, Invoice, Business, Customer, or Customer-person that is synchronized into Wave.

A Wave Customer will merge with a Wave Customer if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer Property
     - Wave Customer Property
   * - email

Wave Vendor to Wave Customer
----------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Vendor and a Wave Customer must be established.

A new Wave Customer will be created from a Wave Vendor if it is connected to a Wave Vendor, Invoice, Business, Customer, or Customer-person that is synchronized into Wave.

A Wave Vendor will merge with a Wave Customer if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Vendor Property
     - Wave Customer Property
   * - email
     - email

Once a link between a Wave Vendor and a Wave Customer is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wave Vendor and a Wave Customer:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Vendor Property
