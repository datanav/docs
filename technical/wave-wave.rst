Wave Customer person to Wave Customer person
--------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer person and a Wave Customer person must be established.

A Wave Customer person will merge with a Wave Customer person if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer person Property
     - Wave Customer person Property
   * - email
     - email

Once a link between a Wave Customer person and a Wave Customer person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wave Customer person and a Wave Customer person:

.. list-table::
