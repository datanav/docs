SuperOffice Contact to PowerOffice GO Customers
-----------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a SuperOffice Contact and a PowerOffice GO Customers must be established.

A new PowerOffice GO Customers will be created from a SuperOffice Contact if it is connected to a SuperOffice User, Person, Contact, Quoteline, or Quotealternative that is synchronized into PowerOffice GO.

A SuperOffice Contact will merge with a PowerOffice GO Customers if one of the following property combinations match:
