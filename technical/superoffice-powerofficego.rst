SuperOffice Contact to Powerofficego Customers
----------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a SuperOffice Contact and a Powerofficego Customers must be established.

A new Powerofficego Customers will be created from a SuperOffice Contact if it is connected to a SuperOffice User, Person, Contact, Quoteline, or Quotealternative that is synchronized into Powerofficego.

A SuperOffice Contact will merge with a Powerofficego Customers if one of the following property combinations match:

   :header-rows: 1

   * - SuperOffice Contact Property
     - Powerofficego Customers Property
   * - Emails.Value
     - EmailAddress

Once a link between a SuperOffice Contact and a Powerofficego Customers is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.
