Tripletex Contact to Powerofficego Customers person
---------------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Tripletex Contact and a Powerofficego Customers person must be established.

A new Powerofficego Customers person will be created from a Tripletex Contact if it is connected to a Tripletex Order, Invoice, or Orderline that is synchronized into Powerofficego.

A Tripletex Contact will merge with a Powerofficego Customers person if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Contact Property
     - Powerofficego Customers person Property
   * - email
     - EmailAddress

Once a link between a Tripletex Contact and a Powerofficego Customers person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.
