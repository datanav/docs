YouTrack Users to Wix Contacts
------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a YouTrack Users and a Wix Contacts must be established.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - YouTrack Users Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
   * - profile.email.email
     - primaryInfo.email

Once a link between a YouTrack Users and a Wix Contacts is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
