PowerOffice GO Contactperson to Wave Customer
---------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a PowerOffice GO Contactperson and a Wave Customer must be established.

A new Wave Customer will be created from a PowerOffice GO Contactperson if it is connected to a PowerOffice GO Powerofficego-salesorder, Powerofficego-salesorders, Powerofficego-salesorderlines, or Powerofficego-outgoinginvoices that is synchronized into Wave.

A PowerOffice GO Contactperson will merge with a Wave Customer if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - PowerOffice GO Contactperson Property
     - Wave Customer Property
   * - emailAddress
     - email

Once a link between a PowerOffice GO Contactperson and a Wave Customer is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.
