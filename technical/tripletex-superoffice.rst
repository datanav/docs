Tripletex Contact to SuperOffice Person
---------------------------------------
Every Tripletex Contact will be synchronized with a SuperOffice Person.

If a matching SuperOffice Person already exists, the Tripletex Contact will be merged with the existing one.
If no matching SuperOffice Person is found, a new SuperOffice Person will be created.

A Tripletex Contact will merge with a SuperOffice Person if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Contact Property
     - SuperOffice Person Property
   * - email
     - Emails.Value

Once a link between a Tripletex Contact and a SuperOffice Person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Tripletex Contact and a SuperOffice Person:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Contact Property
     - SuperOffice Person Property
     - SuperOffice Data Type

Tripletex Customer (human data) to SuperOffice Person
-----------------------------------------------------
Every Tripletex Customer (human data) will be synchronized with a SuperOffice Person.

If a matching SuperOffice Person already exists, the Tripletex Customer (human data) will be merged with the existing one.
If no matching SuperOffice Person is found, a new SuperOffice Person will be created.

A Tripletex Customer (human data) will merge with a SuperOffice Person if one of the following property combinations match:
