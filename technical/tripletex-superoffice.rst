Tripletex Contact to Superoffice Person
---------------------------------------
Every Tripletex Contact will be synchronized with a Superoffice Person.

If a matching Superoffice Person already exists, the Tripletex Contact will be merged with the existing one.
If no matching Superoffice Person is found, a new Superoffice Person will be created.

A Tripletex Contact will merge with a Superoffice Person if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Contact Property
     - Superoffice Person Property
   * - email
     - Emails.Value

Once a link between a Tripletex Contact and a Superoffice Person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.
