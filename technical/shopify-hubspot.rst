Shopify Product to HubSpot Product
----------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Shopify Product and a HubSpot Product must be established.

A new HubSpot Product will be created from a Shopify Product if it is connected to a Shopify Order that is synchronized into HubSpot.

Once a link between a Shopify Product and a HubSpot Product is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Product and a HubSpot Product:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Product Property
     - HubSpot Product Property
     - HubSpot Data Type
