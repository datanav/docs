Wave Customer person to Tripletex Contact
-----------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer person and a Tripletex Contact must be established.

A Wave Customer person will merge with a Tripletex Contact if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer person Property
     - Tripletex Contact Property
   * - email
     - email

Once a link between a Wave Customer person and a Tripletex Contact is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wave Customer person and a Tripletex Contact:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer person Property
     - Tripletex Contact Property
     - Tripletex Data Type
