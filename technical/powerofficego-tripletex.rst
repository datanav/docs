Powerofficego Contactperson to Tripletex Customer person
--------------------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Powerofficego Contactperson and a Tripletex Customer person must be established.

A new Tripletex Customer person will be created from a Powerofficego Contactperson if it is connected to a Powerofficego Salesorder, Salesorders, Salesorderlines, or Outgoinginvoices that is synchronized into Tripletex.

A Powerofficego Contactperson will merge with a Tripletex Customer person if one of the following property combinations match:

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Powerofficego Contactperson Property
     - Tripletex Customer person Property
   * - emailAddress
     - email

Once a link between a Powerofficego Contactperson and a Tripletex Customer person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Powerofficego Contactperson and a Tripletex Customer person:
