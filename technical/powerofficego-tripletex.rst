PowerOffice GO Contactperson to Tripletex Contact
-------------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a PowerOffice GO Contactperson and a Tripletex Contact must be established.

A new Tripletex Contact will be created from a PowerOffice GO Contactperson if it is connected to a PowerOffice GO Powerofficego-projects, Powerofficego-salesorder, Powerofficego-salesorders, Powerofficego-salesorderlines, or Powerofficego-outgoinginvoices that is synchronized into Tripletex.

A PowerOffice GO Contactperson will merge with a Tripletex Contact if one of the following property combinations match:
