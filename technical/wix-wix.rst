Wix.com Members to Wix Contacts
-------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wix.com Members and a Wix Contacts must be established.

A Wix.com Members will merge with a Wix Contacts if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wix.com Members Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
   * - loginEmail
     - info.emails

Once a link between a Wix.com Members and a Wix Contacts is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wix.com Members and a Wix Contacts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wix.com Members Property
