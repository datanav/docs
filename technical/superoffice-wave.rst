SuperOffice Person to Wave Customer person
------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a SuperOffice Person and a Wave Customer person must be established.

A new Wave Customer person will be created from a SuperOffice Person if it is connected to a SuperOffice Sale, Quote, Quoteline, or Quotealternative that is synchronized into Wave.

A SuperOffice Person will merge with a Wave Customer person if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - SuperOffice Person Property
     - Wave Customer person Property
   * - Emails.Value
     - email

Once a link between a SuperOffice Person and a Wave Customer person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.
