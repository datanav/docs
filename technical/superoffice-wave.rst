SuperOffice Person to Wave Customer
-----------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a SuperOffice Person and a Wave Customer must be established.

A new Wave Customer will be created from a SuperOffice Person if it is connected to a SuperOffice Sale, Quote, Quoteline, or Quotealternative that is synchronized into Wave.

A SuperOffice Person will merge with a Wave Customer if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - SuperOffice Person Property
     - Wave Customer Property
   * - Emails.Value
     - email

Once a link between a SuperOffice Person and a Wave Customer is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a SuperOffice Person and a Wave Customer:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
