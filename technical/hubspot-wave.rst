HubSpot Contact to Wave Customer person
---------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a HubSpot Contact and a Wave Customer person must be established.

A new Wave Customer person will be created from a HubSpot Contact if it is connected to a HubSpot Deal, Quote, Lineitem, Quotedealassociation, Dealcompanyassociation, Dealcontactassociation, Lineitemdealassociation, Quotecompanyassociation, Quotecontactassociation, Lineitemquoteassociation, Ticketcompanyassociation, or Quotequotetemplateassociation that is synchronized into Wave.

   * - HubSpot Contact Property
     - Wave Customer person Property
