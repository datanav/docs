Tripletex Employee to Freshteam Employee
----------------------------------------
Every Tripletex Employee will be synchronized with a Freshteam Employee.

If a matching Freshteam Employee already exists, the Tripletex Employee will be merged with the existing one.
If no matching Freshteam Employee is found, a new Freshteam Employee will be created.

A Tripletex Employee will merge with a Freshteam Employee if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Employee Property
     - Freshteam Employee Property
   * - employeeNumber
     - employee_id

Once a link between a Tripletex Employee and a Freshteam Employee is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Tripletex Employee and a Freshteam Employee:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Employee Property
     - Freshteam Employee Property
     - Freshteam Data Type
   * - firstName
     - first_name
     - "string"
   * - lastName
     - last_name
     - "string"
