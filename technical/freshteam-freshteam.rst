Freshteam Employee to Freshteam Employee
----------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Freshteam Employee and a Freshteam Employee must be established.

A Freshteam Employee will merge with a Freshteam Employee if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Freshteam Employee Property
     - Freshteam Employee Property
   * - employee_id
     - employee_id
   * - official_email
     - official_email

Once a link between a Freshteam Employee and a Freshteam Employee is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Freshteam Employee and a Freshteam Employee:

.. list-table::
