HubSpot Contact to Wix Contacts
-------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a HubSpot Contact and a Wix Contacts must be established.

A new Wix Contacts will be created from a HubSpot Contact if it is connected to a HubSpot Deal, Quote, Lineitem, Quotedealassociation, Dealcompanyassociation, Dealcontactassociation, Lineitemdealassociation, Quotecompanyassociation, Quotecontactassociation, Lineitemquoteassociation, Ticketcompanyassociation, or Quotequotetemplateassociation that is synchronized into Wix.

A HubSpot Contact will merge with a Wix Contacts if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - HubSpot Contact Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
   * - properties.email
     - primaryInfo.email

Once a link between a HubSpot Contact and a Wix Contacts is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a HubSpot Contact and a Wix Contacts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - HubSpot Contact Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
     - Wix Data Type
   * - properties.email
     - primaryInfo.email
     - "string"
   * - properties.firstname
     - info.name.first
     - "string"
   * - properties.lastname
     - info.name.last
     - "string"
   * - properties.phone
     - primaryInfo.phone
     - "string"


HubSpot Product to Wix Products
-------------------------------
Every HubSpot Product will be synchronized with a Wix Products.

Once a link between a HubSpot Product and a Wix Products is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a HubSpot Product and a Wix Products:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - HubSpot Product Property
     - Wix Products Property
     - Wix Data Type
   * - properties.hs_cost_of_goods_sold
     - costAndProfitData.itemCost
     - N/A
   * - properties.hs_sku
     - sku
     - "string"
   * - properties.name
     - name
     - "string"
