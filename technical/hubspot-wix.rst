HubSpot Contact to Wix Contacts
-------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a HubSpot Contact and a Wix Contacts must be established.

A new Wix Contacts will be created from a HubSpot Contact if it is connected to a HubSpot Deal, Quote, Lineitem, Quotedealassociation, Dealcompanyassociation, Dealcontactassociation, Lineitemdealassociation, Quotecompanyassociation, Quotecontactassociation, Lineitemquoteassociation, Ticketcompanyassociation, or Quotequotetemplateassociation that is synchronized into Wix.

A HubSpot Contact will merge with a Wix Contacts if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - HubSpot Contact Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
   * - properties.email
     - primaryInfo.email

Once a link between a HubSpot Contact and a Wix Contacts is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a HubSpot Contact and a Wix Contacts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
