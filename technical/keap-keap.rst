Keap Product to Keap Product
----------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Keap Product and a Keap Product must be established.

A Keap Product will merge with a Keap Product if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Keap Product Property
     - Keap Product Property
   * - sku
     - sku

Once a link between a Keap Product and a Keap Product is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Keap Product and a Keap Product:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Keap Product Property
     - Keap Product Property
     - Keap Data Type
