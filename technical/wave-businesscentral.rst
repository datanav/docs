Wave Customer to Business Central Customers person
--------------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer and a Business Central Customers person must be established.

A new Business Central Customers person will be created from a Wave Customer if it is connected to a Wave Invoice that is synchronized into Business Central.

Once a link between a Wave Customer and a Business Central Customers person is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.
