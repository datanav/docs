Shopify Customer to Powerofficego Contactperson
-----------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Shopify Customer and a Powerofficego Contactperson must be established.

A new Powerofficego Contactperson will be created from a Shopify Customer if it is connected to a Shopify Order that is synchronized into Powerofficego.

Once a link between a Shopify Customer and a Powerofficego Contactperson is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Customer and a Powerofficego Contactperson:

.. list-table::

   * - Shopify Customer Property
