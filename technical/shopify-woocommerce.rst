Shopify Order to WooCommerce Order
----------------------------------
Every Shopify Order will be synchronized with a WooCommerce Order.

Once a link between a Shopify Order and a WooCommerce Order is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Order and a WooCommerce Order:
