Zendesk Users to Wix Contacts
-----------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Zendesk Users and a Wix Contacts must be established.

A Zendesk Users will merge with a Wix Contacts if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Zendesk Users Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
   * - email
     - primaryInfo.email

Once a link between a Zendesk Users and a Wix Contacts is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Zendesk Users and a Wix Contacts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Zendesk Users Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
     - Wix Data Type
   * - email
     - primaryInfo.email
     - "string"
