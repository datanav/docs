Shopify Customer to Wave Customer
---------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Shopify Customer and a Wave Customer must be established.

A new Wave Customer will be created from a Shopify Customer if it is connected to a Shopify Order that is synchronized into Wave.

Once a link between a Shopify Customer and a Wave Customer is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Customer and a Wave Customer:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Customer Property
     - Wave Customer Property
     - Wave Data Type
