Wave Customer to Shopify Customer
---------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer and a Shopify Customer must be established.

A new Shopify Customer will be created from a Wave Customer if it is connected to a Wave Invoice that is synchronized into Shopify.

Once a link between a Wave Customer and a Shopify Customer is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wave Customer and a Shopify Customer:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer Property
