Shopify Inventoryitem to Shopify Inventoryitem
----------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Inventoryitem must be established.

A Shopify Inventoryitem will merge with a Shopify Inventoryitem if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
     - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
   * - id
     - id
   * - sku
     - sku

Once a link between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Inventoryitem is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Inventoryitem:

.. list-table::

     - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
     - Shopify Data Type
