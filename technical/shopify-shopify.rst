Shopify Inventoryitem to Shopify Inventoryitem
----------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Inventoryitem must be established.

A Shopify Inventoryitem will merge with a Shopify Inventoryitem if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
     - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
   * - id
     - id
   * - sku
     - sku

Once a link between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Inventoryitem is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Inventoryitem:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
     - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
     - Shopify Data Type


Shopify Inventoryitem to Shopify Product
----------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Product must be established.

A Shopify Inventoryitem will merge with a Shopify Product if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
     - Shopify Product Property
   * - id
     - variants.inventory_item_id

Once a link between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Product is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Inventoryitem and a Shopify Product:

.. list-table::

   * - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
     - Shopify Product Property
     - Shopify Data Type
   * - id
     - variants.inventory_item_id
     - "string"


Shopify Product to Shopify Inventoryitem
----------------------------------------
Every Shopify Product will be synchronized with a Shopify Inventoryitem.

If a matching Shopify Inventoryitem already exists, the Shopify Product will be merged with the existing one.
If no matching Shopify Inventoryitem is found, a new Shopify Inventoryitem will be created.

A Shopify Product will merge with a Shopify Inventoryitem if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Product Property
     - Shopify Inventoryitem Property
   * - variants.inventory_item_id
     - id
