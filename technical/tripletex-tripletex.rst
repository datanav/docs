Tripletex Customer to Tripletex Department
------------------------------------------

A new Tripletex Department will be created from a Tripletex Customer if it is connected to a Tripletex Contact, Employee, or Department that is synchronized into Tripletex.

Once a link between a Tripletex Customer and a Tripletex Department is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Tripletex Customer and a Tripletex Department:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tripletex Customer Property
     - Tripletex Department Property
     - Tripletex Data Type
