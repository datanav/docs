Shopify Customer to Tripletex Contact
-------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Shopify Customer and a Tripletex Contact must be established.

A new Tripletex Contact will be created from a Shopify Customer if it is connected to a Shopify Order that is synchronized into Tripletex.

Once a link between a Shopify Customer and a Tripletex Contact is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Shopify Customer and a Tripletex Contact:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Shopify Customer Property
     - Tripletex Contact Property
     - Tripletex Data Type
