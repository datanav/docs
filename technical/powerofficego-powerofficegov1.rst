Powerofficego Customer to PowerOfficeGov1 Customer
--------------------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Powerofficego Customer and a PowerOfficeGov1 Customer must be established.

A new PowerOfficeGov1 Customer will be created from a Powerofficego Customer if it is connected to a Powerofficego Customer, Supplier, Customers, or Contactperson that is synchronized into PowerOfficeGov1.

A Powerofficego Customer will merge with a PowerOfficeGov1 Customer if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Powerofficego Customer Property
     - PowerOfficeGov1 Customer Property
   * - id
     - id

Once a link between a Powerofficego Customer and a PowerOfficeGov1 Customer is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Powerofficego Customer and a PowerOfficeGov1 Customer:
