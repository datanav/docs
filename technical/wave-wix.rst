Wave Customer person to Wix Contacts
------------------------------------
Before any synchronization can take place, a link between a Wave Customer person and a Wix Contacts must be established.

A Wave Customer person will merge with a Wix Contacts if one of the following property combinations match:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wave Customer person Property
     - Wix Contacts Property
   * - email
     - primaryInfo.email

Once a link between a Wave Customer person and a Wix Contacts is established, it will keep in sync between the two systems, regardless of where it is edited.

The following properties are synchronized between a Wave Customer person and a Wix Contacts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
